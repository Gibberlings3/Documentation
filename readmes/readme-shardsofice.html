      <p>Everyone has their crap mod&mdash;Goo, Alassa, The Circle, The Darkest   Day&mdash;and this is mine. The two quests really aren't all that bad. Not   really. Well, not too much. If you install the Summon Cow spell   restoration component, however, you should be ashamed of yourself.   Really.</p>

      <p> First time installing a mod? Check out <abbr title="The Gibberlings Three">G3</abbr>&#39;s comprehensive tutorial: <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/topic/33164-a-new-player%E2%80%99s-guide-to-installing-and-playing-mods/">A New Player's Guide to Installing and Playing Mods</a>. </p>
      <p> <strong>Enhanced Editions Note</strong><br />
        The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game&#39;s folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages. </p>
      <p> <strong>Windows</strong><br />
        Shards of Ice for Windows is distributed as a self-extracting archive and includes a <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr> installer. To install, simply double-click the archive and follow the instructions on screen. </p>
      <p> Alternatively, the files can be extracted into your game directory using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a> or <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-shardsofice.exe</strong> and the folder <strong>shardsofice</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-shardsofice.exe</strong> and follow the instructions on screen. </p>
      <p> You can run <strong>setup-shardsofice.exe</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components. </p>
      <p> <strong>macOS</strong><br />
        Shards of Ice for macOS is distributed as a compressed tarball and includes a <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr> installer. </p>
      <p> First, extract the files from the tarball into your game directory. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-shardsofice</strong>, <strong>setup-shardsofice.command</strong>, and the folder <strong>shardsofice</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-shardsofice.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen. </p>
      <p> You can run <strong>setup-shardsofice.command</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components. </p>
      <p> <strong>Linux</strong><br />
        Shards of Ice for Linux is distributed as a compressed tarball and does not include a <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr> installer. Linux users will need to do a one-time install of <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr> (and a few other adjustments) as described in <a href="https://moebiusproject.gitlab.io/mods_on_linux">this great writeup</a>. </p>
      <p> To install, run &#39;WeInstall shardsofice in your game folder. </p>
      <p> <strong>Note for Complete Uninstallation</strong><br />
        In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely uninstall the mod using setup-shardsofice --uninstall at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts. </p>

      <p>The mod contains separate components that can be installed independently of one another.</p>
      <p><strong>The Price of Friendship (From Iron Modder) </strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li> Original Release Date: 19 September 2004</li>
        <li> Entered in the Iron Modder VI championship</li>
        <li> We all know friends aren't cheap. They'll take your time, your   attention, your patience... and sometimes your money. But, that's what   friends are for, right?</li>
        <li> SPOILERS: The quest begins in the Trademeet. You must have Imoen in your party (after Spellhold) and rest at the inn.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Some of my Best Friends Are Slimes (From Iron Modder)</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li> Original Release Date: 8 February 2004</li>
        <li> Entered in the Iron Modder II championship</li>
        <li> Not everyone despises a slimey person, right? We've all heard   about some women always falling for the &quot;bad boys.&quot; Such is the story of   Kjobo Pansyflake. Found in her home in the Forest of Tethyr (AR2600),   Kjobo lets you in on her somewhat questionable choice of lifestyle.   While you may find her and her lifestyle somewhat odd, try to be nice   and help her out. There's no need to be judgemental. </li>
        <li> SPOILERS: Kjobo Pansyflake is located in AR2600 (Forest of   Tethyr) at coordinates 401.2785 Heinonny is located in AR1800 (North   Forest) at coordinates 900.1032</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>You Could Restore the Summon Cow Spell, But Why?</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li> Originally part of the alpha release of Unfinished Business, it was quickly removed</li>
        <li> Restores the Summon Cow spell to BG2. When cast, a cow will fall from the sky and land on the target of the caster's choice.</li>
        <li> SPOILERS: The spell can be found in a new store. Talk to Lucy. She'll know. </li>

      <p>Anyone I mention here would probably not want to be associated with this mod. But tough titty.</p>
      <p>Thanks to CamDawg and the rest of the Gibberlings for establishing   such a great community. (Although I'm sure there are much better ways to   celebrate the Gibberlings Three second anniversary than this atrocious   mod).</p>
      <p>Thanks to Jason Compton for the Iron Modder concept, for which the two quests in this mod were created.</p>
      <p>Thanks to Badgert and aerie.ru for developing the Russian translation.</p>
      <p> Thanks to La Voix 2 la Sagesse of the d'Oghmatiques for the French translation. </p>
      <p>Thanks to Jarl and Loenardo Watson for the German translation.</p>
      <p>Thanks to barkingdog for the Simplified Chinese translation. </p>
      <p>Thanks to everyone I've bothered with modding questions over the   years. You know who you are. The usual suspects can insert their names   here.</p>
      <p>Finally, thanks to Beaz for creating the Summon Cow spell bams.</p>

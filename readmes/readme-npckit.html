<p>This mod started as a request (by me) in the Cleric Remix (now Divine Remix)      workroom for Anomen to be awarded a Priest of Helm kit upon passing his knighthood      test. Deciding this was outside Remix's remit I quickly spun it off into      its own mod--perhaps too quickly. A couple of days later I thought that the      mod could be bigger and the <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Kitpack      was born, designed simply to give those <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> without      kits the chance improve their lot. Originally I had only planned on giving      each <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> one of the original      BioWare kits. This, however, turned out not to be feasible. This mod will      add four new kits and provide the opportunity to give a kit to eight of the      BioWare <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym>. </p>

<p>This mod is designed to work with the original Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn (with      or without the Throne of Bhaal expansion pack),  Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition, and the Enhanced Edition Trilogy mod. Some content is also available for Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition or the two BG conversion projects, Baldur's Gate Trilogy and Tutu. The <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Kitpack      should be installed late in the install process for full compatibility. The <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Tweak      Mod and the Holy Symbols Fix component of SimDing0's Tweak Pack are also      fully compatible. That is not to say it is not compatible with other mods--it      will work fine with most other mods, but the changes that are made to kits      by any other mods won't apply to the kits in the <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Kitpack. </p>
<p>Uninstalling any mod that adds or changes kits mid-game and using old save      games with it will generally result in bad experiences, and this mod is no      exception. Half-kitted characters, kits changing on characters, and mixed-up      lines (particularly on the record screen) are all possible symptoms. If you      have a previous version of <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Kitpack      installed, you should finish your current game before upgrading to the latest      version. When upgrading, completely uninstall prior versions before installing      the latest version. </p>

      <p><strong>Enhanced Editions Note</strong><br />
        The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every   patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a   modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as   even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with   your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a   new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. For BG2:EE it is important that you install the mod to the language   version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod   will not show but give error messages. </p>
      <p><strong>Windows</strong><br />
        NPC Kitpack for Windows is distributed as a self-extracting   archive and includes a WeiDU installer. To install, simply double-click   the archive and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, the files can be extracted into your game directory using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a> or <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-npckit.exe</strong> and the folder<strong> npckit</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-npckit.exe</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-npckit.exe</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>Mac OS X</strong><br />
        NPC Kitpack  for Mac OS X is distributed as a compressed tarball and includes a WeiDU installer.</p>
      <p>First, extract the files from the tarball into your game directory. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-npckit</strong>, <strong>setup-npckit.command</strong>, and the folder<strong> npckit</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-npckit.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-npckit.command</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>Linux</strong><br />
        NPC Kitpack  for Linux is distributed as a compressed tarball and does not include a WeiDU installer.</p>
      <p>Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.</p>
      <p>Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="http://www.weidu.org/%7Ethebigg/">WeiDU.org</a> and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal, cd to your game installation directory, run tolower   and answer Y to both queries. You can avoid running the second option   (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save   time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the   first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only   this mod since the last time you lowercased file names. If you're   unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.</p>
      <p>To install, run WeInstall npckit in your game folder. Then run wine BGMain.exe and start playing. </p>
      <p><strong> Note for Complete Uninstallation</strong><br />
        In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely uninstall the mod using setup-npckit --uninstall at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts. . </p>

<p> <strong>Improved Specialist Mage Descriptions</strong> </p>
<p> During the course of making this mod I improved the descriptions of the specialist
  mage kits. I didn't do a lot, I simply combined the mage description with
  the one line of the specialist mage description, and added the specialist's
  school as well as the opposition school. Please see the Conjurer section
  of Edwin's new kit description for an example. </p>
  <p><strong>Replace Berserker Kit with Battlerager for Dwarves</strong></p>
  <p>
    This component will replace the berserker kit option with the battlerager
    when creating a new dwarven fighter character. </p>
  <div class="kit_description">
    <p> BATTLERAGER: The Battlerager fills a particular niche in dwarf society
      and culture. He is a fearless warrior, able to create an insane rage within
      himself, which increases his fighting ability and distorts his physical
      features. While enraged, a Battlerager's face becomes twisted and his teeth
      grind together. Spittle flies from his mouth and dribbles down his beard.
      His eyes enlarge, bulge, and become bloodshot. Size increases as his muscles
      swell and his body expands. His fighting ability becomes awesome, allowing
      him to fight longer and harder than any other dwarf. While in his rage,
      he is almost unstoppable. A dangerous enemy, he is a menace to friend and
      foe alike. </p>
    <p> A Battlerager may not be of any Lawful alignment. </p>
    <p> Advantages:<br>
      - May Enrage for 1 turn once per day per 3 levels </p>
    <p> Disadvantages:<br>
      - Becomes winded after Enraging<br>
      - May not use missile weapons unless they also have a melee component </p>
  </div>
  <p>Battlerager kit adapted from the <em>Complete Book of Dwarves</em>. </p>
  <p><strong>Anomen</strong> <em><br />
    Requires BG2, BG2EE, BGT, or EET
  </em></p>
  <p> Anomen has three components devoted to him, two of which were included in
    the Kit Anomen mod. The components are as follows: </p>
  <ul>
    <li> Anomen will gain the Priest of Helm kit on passing his knighthood test. </li>
    <li> Anomen will gain the Berserker kit on failing his knighthood test. </li>
    <li> Chaotic Neutral Anomen will not get a Holy Symbol. </li>
  </ul>
  <p> Note: Anomen will retain any ranged weapon profiency points (above the
    one allowed) when he gains his berserker kit. He will not be able to gain
    any more points (again, above the one allowed) once he is a Berserker/Cleric. </p>
  <p> <strong>Edwin</strong> </p>
  <p> Edwin is a Red Wizard, but this fact is not mentioned in his kit description.
    Also, his two extra spells per level are not actually explained, although
    we all <i>know</i> they are granted by his amulet. This component will
    add Red Wizard to Edwin's kit description and give some explanation for
    those two extra spells per level. </p>
  <div class="kit_description">
    <p> RED WIZARD: When a bard or minstrel wishes to conjure up images of evil
      magic and darkest sorceries, he need only mention the much-despised name
      of the Red Wizards of Thay. Over the centuries, the clever masters of this
      realm have combined powerful magic, espionage, and devious political maneuvering
      to forge a state of virtually unequalled might. </p>
    <p> The Red Wizards of Thay are called that because of the crimson robes
      they wear when meeting with others of their kind. At other times, donning
      these flowing, richly embroidered garments is optional. In any situation
      where a Red Wizard is attempting to make an impression or otherwise flaunt
      his station, he will wear such attire. If the wizard is attempting to conceal
      his identity, of course, he opts for less obvious dress. </p>
    <p> Red Wizards must be of an Evil alignment. </p>
    <p> Advantages:<br>
      - May cast two extra spells per spell level </p>
    <p> Disadvantages:<br>
      - None </p>
  </div>
  <div class="kit_description">
    <p> CONJURER: The wizard strives to be a master of magical energies, shaping
      them and casting them as spells. To do so, the wizard studies strange tongues
      and obscure facts and devotes much time to magical research. A wizard must
      rely on knowledge and wit to survive. Only the most powerful are ever seen
      adventuring without a retinue of warriors and other partisans. Because
      there are different types (or schools) of magic, there are different types
      of wizards. A Conjurer is a wizard that specializes in creating useful
      creatures and objects. </p>
    <p> School:<br>
      - Conjuration/Summoning </p>
    <p> Opposition School:<br>
      - Divination </p>
  </div>
  <p> Red Wizard description adapted from <em>Wizards and Rogues of the Realms</em>. </p>
  <p> <strong>Imoen and Nalia</strong> </p>
  <p> Imoen and Nalia have a new thief kit, Adventurer, available to them. The
    Adventurer kit provides a small bonus to some thieving skills and removes
    the backstab multiplier. They will also be able to select one of the specialist
    mage kits (excluding Wild Mage), in conjunction with, or separate from,
    the Adventurer kit. In BGEE or Tutu games, you will only have the option of selecting
    a thief kit for Imoen. </p>
  <div class="kit_description">
    <p> ADVENTURER: A jack-of-all-trades, not so much a thief as a character
      who takes advantage of the general thiefly skills on adventures. An Adventurer
      is preferred by many adventuring parties, because he is much less likely
      than other thieves to betray or steal from his own companions. The successful
      Adventurer knows the value of trust and cooperation, while many a "street
      thief" has been raised on duplicity and (sometimes literal) backstabbing. </p>
    <p> Advantages:<br>
      - +20% to Open Locks and Find/Remove Traps </p>
    <p> Disadvantages:<br>
      - No backstab multiplier </p>
  </div>
  <p> Adventurer kit adapted from the <em>Player's Handbook</em>. </p>
  <p>There is a minor cosmetic bug in the application of the adventurer kit--the
    level-up screen, the information box will sometimes claim that Imoen or Nalia's
    backstab multiplier has increased, even though it has not. </p>
  <p> <strong>Korgan</strong> <br />
    <em>Requires BG2, BG2EE, BGT, or EET </em></p>
  <p>Dwarven Berserkers are known as Battleragers, it even says so in the Berserker
    kit description. With this component Korgan will be a proper Battlerager,
    instead of a measly Berserker. The kit description is available above under
    the Replace Berserker Kit with Battlerager for Dwarves component description. </p>
  <p> <strong>Mazzy</strong> <br />
    <em>Requires BG2, BG2EE, BGT, or EET </em></p>
  <p> Mazzy is referred to in the game as a Truesword of Arvoreen, she even has
    some abilities to complement this description. Instead of this psuedo-kit
    I felt she deserved a proper Truesword of Arvoreen kit. However, it turns
    out the Truesword is actually a cleric kit and Mazzy is not a cleric. Taking
    the cleric kit as a base, and being careful not to make the kit as powerful
    as a paladin, I designed for her this new kit: </p>
  <div class="kit_description">
    <p> TRUESWORD OF ARVOREEN: Arvoreen is the nearest thing to a halfling war
      god. He is a god of stern defense and aggressive watchfulness, who is always
      preparing for incursions into halfling lands and making ready to repulse
      hostile creatures at the first sign of trouble. Arvoreen is venerated primarily
      by halfling fighters. </p>
    <p> Fighters that enter the church of Arvoreen, and prove themselves worthy,
      are raised to the rank of Truesword. Trueswords are the protectors and
      defenders of Halfling communities. They mount regular patrols, always investigating
      the slightest hint of a threat. Many Trueswords regularly adventure to
      gain magical weapons and defensive items of all kinds. </p>
    <p> Trueswords of Arvoreen must be halflings of Lawful Good, Neutral Good,
      or Lawful Neutral alignment. </p>
    <p> Advantages:<br>
      - Lay On Hands (heals 1 hit point per level) once per day<br>
      - Detect Evil (as the 1st-level priest spell) once per day<br>
      - From 3rd level can cast Strength (as the 2nd-level wizard spell) once
      per day<br>
      - From 5th level may Invoke Courage for 1 turn once per day per level<br>
      - From 7th level can cast Glyph of Warding (as the 3rd-level priest spell)
      once per day<br>
      - From 9th level can cast Strength of One (as the 3rd-level priest spell)
      once per day<br>
      - From 11th level can cast Haste (as the 3rd level wizard spell, but on
      themselves only) once per day<br>
      - From 14th level can cast Champion's Strength (as the 5th-level priest
      spell) once per day<br>
    </p>
    <p> Disadvantages:<br>
      - Can only place more than one proficiency point in short swords, short
        bows and slings<br>
    </p>
  </div>
  <p> Truesword of Arvoreen kit adapted from <em>Demihuman Deities</em>. </p>
  <p> Mazzy's <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> script will
    also be updated to reflect the changes made. </p>
  <p> <strong>Minsc</strong> </p>
  <p> Minsc is from Rashemen; therefore he is a Rashemaar Ranger. This component
    simply changes Minsc's title from Ranger to Rashemaar Ranger. </p>
  <p> <strong>Sarevok</strong> <br />
    <em>Requires ToB, BG2EE, BGT, or EET </em></p>
  <p> Sarevok's biography mentions that he is a Deathbringer and he comes with
    the Deathbringer Assault melee effect. What is a Deathbringer? I could
    not find any canon sources for a Deathbringer kit, there is a Deathstalker
    kit in <em>Faiths and Avatars</em>, but a Deathstalker is a specialty priest
    of Bhaal. I didn't feel this fit Sarevok, as his goal in (his first) life
    was to become a god and replace Bhaal. Plus Bhaal is dead and Sarevok is
    a fighter. So this new kit is one of entirely my own design--hope you like
    it. </p>
  <div class="kit_description">
    <p> DEATHBRINGER: A Deathbringer is not, as the name suggests, a bloodthirsty
      killer, but a master of the fine art of intimidation in combat. Every stance
      and gesture is designed to maximize their opponent's fear and minimize
      their own. The goal is to so frighten the opponent that they are unable
      to fight back. Eventually it is possible for them to kill with a single
      blow, not from physical damage but from mental. </p>
    <p> A Deathbringer's first instinct is to cause fear. As a result, it is
      difficult for Deathbringers not to intimidate people and, indeed, determine
      when not to intimidate people. Their body language outside combat makes
      people pause and worry. However, they can easily recognize and suppress
      any fear in themselves. Their goal is to frighten not be frightened. </p>
    <p> Advantages:<br>
      - Immune to fear and morale failure<br>
      - From 6th level can cast Spook (as the 1st level wizard spell) once per
      day per 5 levels<br>
      - At 11th level gains Deathbringer Assault </p>
    <p> Disadvantages:<br>
      - -3 penalty to Wisdom and Charisma </p>

      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>Fixed bug where Imoen was not being kitted in Tutu games </li>
        <li>Fixed bug where Imoen, if not dual-classed, would still get her class        name changed to 'Adventurer/Mage' (i.e. in Tutu and <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym> games) </li>
        <li>Fixed bug where the adventurer kit would erroneously mention an increase        in backstab multiplier at level-up </li>

        <li>A great deal of under-the-hood changes to streamline installation. Notably,        there's no longer a 'master component' which needs to be installed, and        the mage kit options for Imoen and Nalia are now presented in much more        user-friendly menu options </li>
        <li>Added new Replace Berserker Kit with Battlerager for Dwarves component </li>
        <li>If <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Tweak is installed,        Anomen's new equipment from that mod is now adjusted to still work if Anomen        gets the berserker or Helm kits</li>

        <li>Fixed bug on non-Fixpack installs where Spellhold Imoen doesn't have        a script assigned, causing her kitting to fail</li>
        <li>Magic Missile is a disallowed spell for enchanters, so if Imoen is kitted        as an enchanter she'll use Larloch's Minor Drain in the initial <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> Promenade        cutscene instead </li>
        <li><acronym title="High Level Ability">HLA</acronym> tables for the new        kits now use the generic tables for their classes (instead of their own        copies) for better compatibility with <acronym title="High Level Ability">HLA</acronym>-altering        mods such as Refinements </li>

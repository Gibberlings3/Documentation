  <p><strong><a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/">A Gibberlings Three Mod</a><br />
  Authors: Art by Plasmocat, <a href="http://www.spellholdstudios.net">www.spellholdstudios.net</a>,
  packaged by Cmorgan <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net">www.gibberlings3.net</a></strong></p>
  <p><strong>Version 1 - <a href="http://gibberlings3.net/forums/index.php?app=downloads&amp;showcat=31">Check
  for the most recent version</a></strong></p>
</div>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>This is a package to provide additional custom portraits for assignment
    to your Player Character (<acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym>). It contains no additional content and does
    not touch your installation.</p>
</div>
<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>There are no known incompatibilities. The Pick of the Litter simply copies
  Plasmocat's portraits into the portraits subdirectory of your game directory.
  Assign the appropriate portraits to your PC  through the character
  generation screen. Be sure to use the S and M portraits for <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym>, Tutu, <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>, or
  <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym>. The large portraits are for the end of the trilogy epilogue, and are not
  assigned to the creature file.</p>

<h2>Contents</h2>
<div class="section">  
  <p><b>These are some of my favorite portraits,</b> many of which were
    commissioned for various mods and others which are just portraits I wanted to
    make from the photos of models I thought were interesting. Not all of my
    favorite edits are represented in this pack because I didn't include portraits
    which were manipulations of anime (with one exception) or were tweaks of other
    artists I did to suit my own character needs. I also didn't include
    non-humanoid characters--such as the half-orc, the kobold, and the gibberling
    I've done--mainly because I wanted to finish each of them out a little more in
    different ways and haven't found the time for them yet. Instead, I tried to
    stick to work I had done from photos of models, pieces of clothing/armor, and
  landscapes I found myself.</p>
  
  <p>Previews of the portraits can be found in <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/portraits/thumbnails.php?album=25">the
      portrait gallery</a>. </p>
  <p>As always, thanks to all the people who have Beta'd
        for me and who have supported me with encouragement along the way. And
        thanks to all the people who have challenged me with interesting requests
        that made me really explore the limits of what I could do.</p>
  <p> Mucho thanks and many beers for cmorgan for scripting this mod for me.
    I greatly appreciate your help.  </p>
  <p> Take care &amp; enjoy!</p>

<h2>Credits and Copyright Information</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p><b>Disclaimer:</b> I want to be clear that I do not claim to own copyright
  over any of the material I manipulated for these works. Those photographs
  and/or paintings remain the property of the original artists. Because of this
  I do not charge for my work or make any claims of proprietary rights over the
  material. </p>
  <p><b>Further, if anyone sees a photo portion or a face they don't wish to be
  distributed, </b>I'm more than happy to pull that portrait from release. If I
  knew the model or if the person commissioning the work knew the model, I've
  always asked permission before I shared their portraits publicly. The models
  whose permission I could get were obtained prior to the release of this mod,
  whether it was recently or at the time of the commission. However, if a model
  sees his or her face in this pack and changes his or her mind about wanting to
  be included, I have no problem removing the portrait after the fact. In any
  case, for the sake of privacy, I won't identify the models whether they are
  professional or not.</p>
  <p><b>This mod was created to be freely enjoyed</b> by all Baldur's Gate 1, 2
  Tutu, and <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym> players. However, it should not be sold, published,
  compiled or redistributed in any form without the consent of Plasmocat.</p>

<div class="section">  <strong>I hope you enjoy using these portraits</strong> as much as I enjoyed
  making them and playing them myself. Thanks to everyone who has provided constructive
  feedback, both challenging and inspiring me to do better work. I appreciate
  your support.
  <p> This mod started as a personal project because I wanted to use Tutu to
    improve the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> interface but at
    the same time really don't like the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> style
    of portraits. Rather than continue to use pics of completely different characters
    to hedge the problem, I decided to do a revamp of the whole works. </p>
  <p>A few notes on the pics: I completely refaced (literally) Shar Teel and
    Faldorn because it's just my preference to have better-looking people in
    my games. I also completely overhauled Coran, making him look more like an
    elf rather than a mutant human. I collaborated with Domi on this in that
    she Beta'd my work and provided some pen &amp; ink drawings of elves she
    obtained from official <acronym title="Dungeons and Dragons">D&amp;D</acronym> illustrations.
    I tried to create a hybrid style that incorporated these old school elements
    with some of the traits portrayed in the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> elves
    as well, all while keeping his &quot;am I not hot?&quot; personality evident.
    I gave Alora red hair instead of pink because I didn't want her to compete
    or become confused with Imoen. </p>
  <p>I made two versions of Xzar, one presenting him in the colors he wears in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> and
    one reflecting the colors he wears in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>.
    You can choose which one to install! I also created two versions of Imoen;
    one suitable for a Swashbuckler, and the other more consistent with Imoen's <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> character.
    You have a choice of one of these as well. </p>
  <p>I didn't make replacement portraits for Edwin or Minsc; if you want to use
    the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> versions on a Tutu game,
    install <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Caharacter">NPC</acronym> and
    the portraits are there. I did edit the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> Jaheira
    portrait mainly because I wanted to use it as a <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym>.</p>
  <p> I hope you enjoy using these portraits as much as I enjoyed making them
    and playing them myself. Thanks to everyone who has provided constructive
    and appreciative feedback. I appreciate your support. Thanks to CamDawg for
    providing space for my stuff. Special thanks to cmorgan for making this mod
    happen, because I don't do my own scripting and wanted to make these portraits
    available. I'm honored to work with you and grateful for your help. </p>

      release. If I knew the model or if the person commissioning the work knew
      the model, I've always asked permission before I shared their portraits
      publicly. The models whose permission I could get were obtained prior to
      the release of this mod, whether it was recently or at the time of the
      commission. However, if a model sees his or her face in this pack and changes
      his or her mind about wanting to be included, I have no problem removing
      the portrait after the fact. In any case, for the sake of privacy, I won't
      identify the models whether they are professional or not.</p>

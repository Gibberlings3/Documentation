			Ajantis Portrait Pack Modification 
  for BG1 (with or without TotSC), BG1Tutu v4, EasyTutu, BGT, BG:EE, BGII:EE, and  EET
				


This portrait pack includes alternate Ajantis portraits formerly included in the Sir Ajantis for BGII mod as well as the Ajantis BG1 Expansion Modification. 

The portraits will be used for BG1 Ajantis as well as jastey's Sir Ajantis BGII mod, independent on install order. The Ajantis Portrait Pack detects automatically the game install. 

NOTE: For all games, the portraits have the same naming convention as the BG1 default portrait since with v15 and up, the Sir Ajantis for BGII mod uses the BG1 portrait (which is also present in all BG2 games). This means, that if you installed an Ajantis portrait from another source, that the same portrait will be used as well in the BGII part of the game without need of further action.

Many thanks to the artists for granting permition to include them as alternatives for Ajantis: Amaurea, Azguz aka Azze, berelinde, Casul, Catlepha, Miloch, Senka and wonnimchunha!

The portraits can be looked at at the Gibberlings3 Portrait Gallery:

INSTALLATION
 
Extract the contents of the archive to your game's main directory. 
Your game's main directory would be one of the following:
- your main original Baldur's Gate (II) (:EE) folder, or
- your main EasyTutu folder if you are playing EasyTutu, or
- your main Tutu folder if you are playing Tutu, or
- your main BGT folder if you are playing BGT.

Run the "setup-ajantisportraitpack" executable. Choose the language you prefer and confirm installation. This should extract all needed files to the override folder.

NOTE: BG(II):EE are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. 

You do not have to start a new game to see the changes to Ajantis' portrait.

COMPATIBILITY

All the mod does is copying bmp-files to the override. There should be no compatibility problems with other mods. Only incompatibility would be with other mods that apply portraits to Ajantis (like other Portrait Packs), or that change the files in a way that the portrait file name does no longer match (not that I know of).



CREDITS

custom portraits are from:

Amaurea (portraits based on Heath Ledger)
Azguz aka Azze (edit from an original BG portrait: Cernd)
berelinde (with Dragon Age - Origin Character Creation Tool)
Casul (edit from an original BG portrait: PC choice)
Catlepha
Miloch (edit from an original BG portrait: Ajantis)
Senka (edit from an original BG portrait: Ajantis)
wonnimchunha

Translations:

I used the French lines by Galathée (of the d'Oghmatiques), but I added some more, so if you see a mistake it was my poor French.

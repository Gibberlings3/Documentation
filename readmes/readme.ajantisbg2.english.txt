                           jastey's Sir Ajantis NPC for BGII Modification
			for original BGII+ToB, BGT, BGII:EE, and EET
                             
                                         Version 20

ABOUT

jastey's Sir Ajantis NPC for BGII modification introduces Ajantis, the known BG1 NPC, paladin of the Order of the Radiant Heart into the SoA and ToB part of the game. 
With this modification Ajantis can be acquired as a member of the PC's group after the fight in the Windspear Hills (which was not changed by the mod principally). The player must then solve a quest to free Ajantis from Firkraag's ransom. 
The modification contains a fully developed engaged romance path, which continues the Ajantis Romance from the BG1 NPC Project [Gibberlings Three (Tutu/BGT), for vanilla BG1: BG1 Ajantis Expansion Mod]; a new beginnings romance, and a friendship path.
Contentwise, the mod assumes that Ajantis travelled with the PC in BG1 for some time. It was there that Ajantis gained enough honor to be knighted.
EET, BGT: in a continuous game Ajantis will not spawn in BGII if he never joined the goup.
ToB: Ajantis will not travel with an evil aligned PC in ToB.

For the EE games (BGII:EE and EET) the second optional component will install the BeamDog inventory BAM for Ajantis' family shield (green dragon on golden ground). If not installed, the BG1NPC Project shield graphic will be used.

From v19, the crossmod component is no longer part of tis mod, but moved into the Crossmod Banter Pack. (Note to modders: the DESIGNATED 2 of this former component is no longer used in teh mod.)

The now third optional component gives the choice to install the mature romance content (not teen rated). Please note that deinstalling this component midgame will not revert the mature romance level. Do not install this component if you want the romance to be teen rated.

The 4th optional component gives the possibility to chose a different time between lovetalks in SoA. The standard of 1h between lovetalk is the default value and already installed by the main component. Only chose one of the install components if you want to have a different timer than 1h between lovetalks. To revert back to 1h, just uninstall this component.

THe 5th component gives the possibility to make Ajantis Cavalier. Please note that this takes only effect before Ajantis was met the first time in the agem, and also, that deinstalling this component midgame (after meeting Ajantis) will not revert his class back to plain Paladin.




The alternate portraits available in versions lower than 5 are now in a separate modification: The Ajantis Portrait Pack, also available from the Kerzenburg and Gibberlings Three download sections. 

One does NOT need to start a new game to gain the quest and have Ajantis join the party. The quest to retrieve Ajantis starts in Firkraag's lair (on the stairs in front of the room where Garren's kidnapped child is kept prisoner). This happens whether or not Firkraag has been defeated.

Even so, to play the full content for the engagement path, it is recommended to start the game at least in Irenicus' Dungeon. The engagement path adds additional content of which some will only be experienced before the original game fight in the Windspear Hills.


NOTE: The Sir Ajantis for BGII mod uses the same naming convention for the portraits as the BG1 default portrait (v15 and up). Thus, for BGT and EET, if you installed an Ajantis portrait from another source, the same portrait will be used as well in the BGII part of the game without need of further action.



BGT & EET CONTINUITY

For BGT and EET in a continuous game, status of BG1 (BG1NPC) romance is detected automatically for flawless continuity.
Also, status of Ajantis' and the PC's meeting in BG1 is detected and considered. Ajantis will *not* spawn (i.e. the quest will not trigger, if):
-Ajantis died and was left for dead in BG1
-Ajantis turned hostile in BG1
-Ajantis never joined the party in BG1

For a new BGII run in BGT and EET, the mod will give the possibility to chose the status of Ajantis' and PC's friendship as it is for BGII and BGII:EE.

For a continuous game in EET, Ajantis will have a chest in the Order of the Radiant Heart, in the common squire/knight leasure room. You will find all items Ajantis had when he left in SoD in there.

Other than that, no continuity will be provided, i.e. Ajantis will spawn with the mod creature file and will probably not have the stats you gave him in BG1. Level1NPCs could be a way to customize the BGII Ajantis the way you want it.



CHOICE OF ROMANCE StATUS (for new BGII(EE) game)

For a PC that fulfills the romance criteria, the choice of romance has to be made in the game. There are several possibilities before the first meeting with Ajantis to make this choice (of which the player only gets to see one, of course). The choices in SoA are the following:
-Engaged path: "Ajantis is your fiance". The romance of BG1 will be continued.
-New beginnings romance: "Ajantis was your travel companion at the Sword Coast".
-Engagement broke at the Sword Coast: This option is included to present the full choice. It will lead to the pure friendship path, i.e. no romance will trigger. It includes a short greeting upon the first meeting to account for the past.
In ToB, the choice can be made in the greetings dialogue after summoning Ajantis via the fate spirits in the pocket plane.


ENGAGED PATH (soA)

For detailed information about the engaged romance please refer to the "romance_guide_EngagedPath.txt"! The engaged path assumes that Ajantis already travelled with the PC in BG1 and that my Ajantis BG1-Romance was played until the end [Ajantis romance of the BG1NPC Projec (G3, for Tutu or BGT) or BG1 Ajantis Expansion Mod (Kerzenburgforum, for original BG1)].

The engaged path contains the following extra features:
-16 cyclic love talks
-Several more event-triggered dialogues
-13 dialogues that are triggered before the party rests (cyclic lovetalks do not depend on these)
-Ajantis-initiated flirts, that can be switched off and on via the PID menu
-PIDs and PI flirts, changing dependent on the place and the chapter of the game.
-Several dialogues the PC can start via the PID menu.
-In Irenicus' Dungeon lies a personal BG1-romance item for the PC
-In the headquarters of the Order of the Radiant Heart, the PC can ask about Ajantis' whereabouts. Sir Ryan Trawl notices upon their first meeting that the PC is Ajantis' fiancee (for this to happen, the choice of the romance path already had to be made in the game).
-Ajantis and the PC can marry
-choice of 12 different wedding rings; the choice can either be done by visiting the goldsmith or by ordering a bag of sample rings by Ajantis (only in reachable areas)
-Ajantis presents the PC a gift item, and also the PC can buy a gift for Ajantis after they have talked about it in one of the lovetalks.
-Romance conflict with Anomen: As long as Ajantis and the PC are not married, the Anomen romance will continue in slightly adapted form. Changes to the Anomen romance consist of additional replies for the PC to politely decline Anomen's approaches and talk about Ajantis as a fellow Order member. After the marriage, the Anomen romance will proceed until after his knighting test. Then it will be deactivated.


NEW BEGINNINGS ROMANCE PATH (SoA)

For more detailed information about the new beginnings romance please refer to "romance_guide_NewbeginningsRomance.txt"!
The new beginnings romance will be triggered for all PCs that fulfill the romance criteria if the engaged path was not chosen. In addition, it will trigger for half-orc female PCs (non-evil alignment etc.) directly. 
The new beginnings romance develops out of the friendship path, with additional, flirty dialogue options and additional lovetalks.
This path assumes that Ajantis did not tell the PC about his love in BG1, but they already travelled together at the Sword Coast. It is also assumed that the PC walked the path of good and did not insult Ajantis in any way back then.
For a PC who makes good decisions throughout the game and whose reputation is above 15 at a certain point, Ajantis will make a love confession, albeit very late in the game.

Special content of the new beginnings romance:
-The 11 friendshippath dialogues, in slightly changed fashion.
-At least 7 more event triggered dialogues.
-Several dialogues that are accessible via the PID menu
-Ajantis-initiated flirts, depending on the development status of the romance. The flirts can be deactivated via PID option.
-PID with place and chapter depending flirts.


ROMANCE IN TOB

There is only one romance track in ToB. The marriage cannot be celebrated in ToB due to the rush of events. There is dialogues, PID and interjections.


FRIENDSHIP PATH

For more detailed information about the friendship path please refer to "FriendshipPath_guide.txt"!
The friendship path is for all PCs who do not fit in Ajantis' romance interest, or if the option "BG1 romance broke up on the Sword Coast" was chosen in the game.
It contains 11 cyclic dialogues and one smaller encounter, as well as PIDs. 



ADDITIONAL CONTENT
 
-Quest "searching for Ajantis" with custom indoor area
-More event triggered dialogues
-Interjections to game events
-At Garren's place, the PC and Ajantis will meet Eila, Garren's niece who knows Ajantis from their childhood. To this, a small quest will start later in the Government District.
-Ajantis has at least two banters with every non-evil BioWare NPC. With some evil-aligned NPCs, he has only one. Ajantis will not stay in the group with Dorn or Hexxat.
-Ajantis has his family shield (from BG1 romance), which can be upgraded by Cromwell and Cespenar.

-The first Mae'Var quest, stealing from a temple, was extended so the item doesn't have to be stolen to finish it. Just talk directly to the highest priest in the temple (Wheathermistress Ada / Dawnmaster Kreel). This quest extension is available independently on whether Ajantis is in the party. The mod Alternatives offers the same content, the mods are compatible.


GENERAL

-One does NOT need to start a new game to be able to play the modification with the main quest and romances, even if Firkraag is defeated and the Windspear Hills battles have been fought. Nevertheless, the story will be most convincing if the mod is installed before the first visit of the Windspear Hills. Also, there is content for the engaged path romance that is meant to be seen before the first meeting with Ajantis. It will only trigger if Ajantis is not yet in the party.
-Ajantis has the same stats as in original BG1, only his WIS was increased by 3 points like Anomen's after his knighthood test.
-The PC's decisions are counted and weighted in terms of good and evil in the game. To see what Ajantis counts as good or evil decision please refer to "Ajantis_reactions.txt". If the PC makes too many "evil" decisions, an active romance will break.
-The Ajantis romance will be only active as long as the PC does not commit herself to Anomen or Rasaad, Dorn, or Hexxat. Ajantis is included in the romance conflicts of the Crossmod Banter Pack (G3), i.e. his romance will also be stopped if the PC commits to a romance with another mod-NPC if you install the CBP.
-the main quest does not have to be played fully: instead of going through the portal, the priests of Oghma in the Dock District can revert it, so that Ajantis will be available instantly. Note that this will mean that the quest cannot be played and that there will be no quest rewards.

Communication with Ajantis:
In addition to the dialogues that Ajantis starts himself, there is the possibility to talk with him using the player initiated dialogue PID. Most options are mostly random-triggered replies that can be chosen as often as desired without any further consequences. But under the option "I want to talk to you", there are dialogues that can be held only once. They are event based, so from time to time during gameplay, new options are added. In ToB, Ajantis can be asked to his thoughts and he will reply with several dialogues to current game events, so make sure to ask him as long as this PID option "I want to talk to you" is available.
Note:
1. the option 'I would like to talk to you' *only* appears if there are new reply options present. 
2. Ajantis gives a DisplayStringHead 'I am ready to answer new questions' if new PIDs options are available in the 'I would like to talk to you' section. 
3. Any question in this section cycles back to the 'I would like to talk to you' section, so all active questions can be asked in one go without having to activate the PID again and again (this might turn out to be a nuisance for instances later in game if there was only one question active, though).

Note: Ajantis has PIDs throughout the whole game, also in the Underworld and in hell. Let your PC talk to him to see the changed PID options!


KNOWN ISSUES

-There are PID options that trigger a normal dialogue. This leads to a "break" in the dialogue where Ajantis says something like "yes, let us talk about this" but then follows an "END DIALOGUE" and depending on the script run some seconds could pass until the dialogue is triggered. This is intentional behavior.



INSTALLATION 


NOTE: BG(II):EE are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. 

For EET, install this mod to the BGII:EE folder after the EET transformation (i.e. somewhere after EET_main.exe) but before running the final EET-end.exe.


-Windows

Make sure you back up your dialog.tlk file (and dialogf.tlk, if it exists), just to be sure.
Extract the contents of the archive to your game's main directory (BGII - SoA).

Run the "Setup-ajantisbg2.exe" program. Choose the language you prefer and confirm installation. This will start extracting the needed files to the override folder. 
After compilation of the files the sound files will be extracted. Please wait with closing the installation window until the sound extraction is completed!

-Linux

The mod depends on oggdec for linux as it is not supplied in the mod package.


CROSSMOD

All crossmod for Sir Ajantis for BGII mod that needs the other mods' dialogue is included in the Crossmod Banter Pack: https://www.gibberlings3.net/mods/npcs/crossmod/
Please install the Crossmod Banter Pack to experience Ajantis's full personality, especially for the Alternatives mod and the dagger quest in Skie - Cost of one Girl's Soul if you have those mod installed.


COMPATIBILITY

General: Sir Ajantis NPC for BGII Mod is coded using WeiDU, and it does not overwrite any files.


Smiling Imp's BG1 NPCs for SoA&ToB: compatibility is realized by its Ajantis component being skipped if my mod is installed first. If you want to encounter both Ajantis in the game, you have to install Smiling Imp's BG1 NPCs for SoA&ToB first.

Dungeon-Be-Gone: in case someone does not want to switch to the better and serious alternative 'Skip Chateau Irenicus', the missing of a mod item that would be found in Irenicus Dungeon is covered by the Ajantis mod, so nothing is missed out.

Mods that are fully compatible although they sound like they could be conflicting (this does not mean that mods / components not listed here are not compatible):

-'Sensible Entrance Points' of BGII Tweakpack (G3), independent of install order.

- Skip Chateau Irenicus (from Argent77)

- Questpack (PPG) (with reganrds to components 'Revised Hell Trials', 'Improved Oasis II', 'Miscellaneous Enhancements': "dispel the illusion from the initial encounter in the Windspear Hills".)




BUG REPORTS

In case you encounter bugs or issues while playing that are caused by the Ajantis modification please post your report in the forum or send me an email.

In all cases I will answer as soon as possible.


DECLARATION

Feel free to adjust / change this mod to your liking for your privtate use. Feel free to copy and use any code of this mod (although I would not recommend it as it is outdated). 

Ajantis is a BioWare NPC. Feel free to write dialogue for Ajantis in your own mod, without contacting me. Feel also free if you wish to contact me about content you add to BGII Ajantis in your own mod, of course. Feel free to let your NPC react to Ajantis' dialogue or quests of this mod.

With all these "feel frees", I would be happy if you play fair and don't try to ridicule Ajantis or make him in any way sound offensive (not in a way that is not in lign with his BioWare's characterisation, that is).

That said, Ajantis might be a BioWare NPC but his appearance (alive) in BGII via this mod is my doing. I therefore expect any crossmod to be in accordance to the character this mod draws of him. If you want Ajantis to fall in love with your NPC or start an affair of some sort, I expect you to contact me before releasing something like this.


I want to thank all who have helped me making this mod.

Have fun playing the Ajantis NPC mod!

jastey

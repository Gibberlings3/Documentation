1. INTRO

This is a contest entry in which I got a little bit carried away. 

2. INSTRUCTIONS

Install the mod by running setup-cliffhistory.exe.

Go to the Five Flagons Playhouse and complete Raelis' quest (or kill her). When Raelis has disappeared (either by
completing the Planar Prison, letting her go back to the Planes by herself, or killing her), wait a day, then come back
to the Five Flagons Playhouse. Talk to the receptionist, buy a ticket, then show it to the usher.

There are multiple ways to end the quest, but be nice to Fonick for the best (or worst) outcome.

3. CONFLICTS AND ISSUES

** If you are a bard, or have the "Multiple Strongholds" component from "Ease of Use" mod installed, this may not work
for you!  I haven't tested this mod when you have access to the stronghold, although theoretically, it should work.  
You will likely see strange scenarios with the Stronghold quests if it does work, but this should not actually affect
the Stronghold quests themselves. **

4. SPOILERS

Fonick is a joinable lawful good NPC who will banter once with everybody in your party (except Imoen). He carries a book, his Epicopus, in which he will write notes about his travels with Charname. He will add about 14 notes over the course of
your travels and you will be alerted with a sound and a message each time. He comes with his own kit, the Delusionist
bard kit, which will not be available to the player character. When you meet him, he only carries a wooden sword. He doesn't interject much yet. And his stats are awful. :) 

His entries appear after:
- A banter with Anomen
- Finding out about the Umar Hills witch from Mayor Lloyd in Umar Hills
- Completing the Circus Quest
- Killing the Unseeing eye
- Killing Firkraag
- The death of Lavok from the Planar Sphere
- Defeating the Shade Lord
- Saving Trademeet
- Travelling to Brynnlaw
- 'Becoming' a drow
- Travelling to the Underdark
- Travelling to Suldanesselar
- Defeating Irenicus
- Seeing Hell

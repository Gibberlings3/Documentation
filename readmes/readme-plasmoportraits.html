<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="section">

</div>
<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>This mod is designed to work with <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>: Shadows of Amn with or without the expansion pack Throne of Bhaal. There are no known incompatibilities. </p>
</div>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p> <strong>Windows</strong><br />
    Plasmocat's Portrait Pack is packaged and installed with <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> and is distributed as a self-extracting archive. To install, simply double-click the archive and follow the instructions on screen. </p>
  <p> Alternatively the files can be extracted from the archive using <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/">WinRAR</a>. If properly extracted, you should have a plasmoportraits folder and setup-plasmoportraits.exe in your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder. To install, simply double-click setup-plasmoportraits.exe and follow the instructions on screen. </p>
  <p> Please run setup-plasmoportraits.exe in your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components. </p>
  <p><strong>Mac OS X</strong> <br />
    <em>If the mod was previously installed, uninstall it before extracting the new version.</em> Plasmocat's Portrait Pack is packaged and installed with <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>. To install, simply extract the contents of the mod into your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder.&nbsp; If properly extracted, you should have a plasmoportraits folder, setup-plasmoportraits, and setup-plasmoportraits.command in your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder. To install, simply double-click <strong>setup-plasmoportraits.command </strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
	<p><strong>Linux</strong><br />
Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify. Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="http://www.weidu.org/~thebigg "><acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>.org</a> and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal, cd to your BG2 installation directory, run 'tolower' and answer Y to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only this mod since the last time you lower cased file name. If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.<br />
Run <strong>WeInstall plasmoportraits</strong> in your game folder to install the mod. Then run <strong>wine BGMain.exe</strong> and start playing.</p>

  <p><strong>Replace BG2 NPC portraits </strong><br />

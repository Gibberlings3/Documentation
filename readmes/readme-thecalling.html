      <p>The Calling really started as a collection of random questions from BG--why      didn't anyone take over the gnoll stronghold, considering the two bordering      nations are on the brink of war? How come the only class-specific quests      in the game are with Narlen Darkwalk? Why isn't Melicamp used more? While      the original idea was more along the lines of a stronghold mod for BG, it      grew into a planned collection of class-specific quests. Many others were also eager      to contribute their quest ideas as well.</p>
      <p>So far, only one class quest--mages--has been completed. Given this, it has been made available to all classes until further quests are completed. </p>

      <p>There are no known incompatibilities at this time, though the mod is still       in development. It was developed in tandem with BG1 NPC, Sirine's Call,       Tweaks Anthology, Unfinished Business for BG, jastey's Slime Mini-Quest, and Song      and Silence. jastey and DavidW have also been assisting in development, to      minimize the risk of conflicts between jastey's  BG Mini-Quest Pack      and DavidW's Sword Coast Stratagems. </p>

        <p><strong>Special Note for Siege of Dragonspear from Steam/GOG<br />
        </strong>Good Old Games (GOG) and Steam both package the   additional content for Siege of Dragonspear in a method that WeiDU, the   tool used to install this mod, cannot access. You must  run a program   called <a href="https://github.com/Argent77/A7-DlcMerger/releases">DLC Merger</a> on your SoD installation  before you can install this or any other WeiDU-based mod. </p>
        <p><strong>Enhanced Editions Note</strong><br />
          The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note   that every   patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the   middle of a   modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if   possible) as   even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able   to continue with   your old save games. Alternatively, copy the whole   game's folder into a   new one that can be modded and will stay   untouched by game patches. For BG:EE it is important that you install   the mod to the language   version you are playing the game in.   Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod   will not show but give error   messages. </p>
        <p><strong>Windows</strong><br />
          The Calling for Windows is distributed as a   self-extracting   archive and includes a WeiDU installer. To install,   simply double-click   the archive and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, the files can be extracted into your game directory using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a> or <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-thecalling.exe</strong> and the folder <strong>thecalling</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-thecalling.exe</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
        <p>You can run <strong>setup-thecalling.exe</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
        <p><strong>macOS</strong><br />
          The Calling for macOS is distributed as a compressed tarball and includes a WeiDU installer.</p>
        <p>First, extract the files from the tarball into your game directory. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-thecalling</strong>, <strong>setup-thecalling.command</strong>, and the folder <strong>thecalling</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-thecalling.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
        <p>You can run <strong>setup-thecalling.command</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
        <p><strong>Linux</strong><br />
          The Calling for Linux is distributed as a compressed   tarball and does not   include a WeiDU installer.  Linux users will need   to do a one-time   install of <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility"><abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr></abbr> (and a few other adjustments) as described in <a href="https://moebiusproject.gitlab.io/mods_on_linux" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">this great writeup</a>. </p>
        <p>To install, run 'WeInstall thecalling' in your game folder. </p>
        <p><strong> Note for Complete Uninstallation</strong><br />
          In addition to the methods above for removing individual   components, you can completely uninstall the mod using   setup-thecalling --uninstall at the command line to remove all   components without wading through prompts.      </p>

      <p>The Calling has several different components, of which each can be installed      independently of one another. </p>
      <p><strong>The Calling </strong><br />
        <em>Currently only available in English, French, and Polish</em></p>
      <p> This component is planned as a series of class-specific quests for the game, though only one--the mage quest--is currently implemented,  though at present the class restrictions are   not implemented so it's open to all players. The   PC will be offered        one set based on his or her class (a   'calling') and can choose to accept        or decline. Players can only   have one calling per game, though at present the class restrictions are   not implemented. The new quests are generally triggered by the   completion        of an existing quest; sometimes the calling will   involve several small        quests or one large one. </p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Mage</em>: Thalantyr will initiate the mage calling after Melicamp is saved.</li>
        <li><em>Other</em>: Other callings are still under development.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Peaceful Werewolf Isle Resolution (DavidW) </strong><br />
        <em>Requires Tales of the Sword Coast, also available in SCS</em></p>
      <p> This idea was originally developed by DavidW for Sword Coast   Stratagems and      donated to The Calling. This component allows for   the possibility of not      having to fight Kaishas at the final escape   from the island, though it depends      on your actions around the   island and other factors. </p>
      <p><strong>Exotic Items Pack</strong><br />
        <em>Also available in Tweaks Anthology</em></p>
      <p> This component adds a handful of weapons and items available in Baldur's          Gate II and scatters them throughout stores, creatures, and containers in          the Baldur's Gate portion of the game. Items include katanas, wakizashis,          scimitars, ninja-tos, bags/quivers of plenty, ioun stones, and a handful          of spell scrolls. However, please note that the items have been placed with          an eye towards balance and likelihood that they would be on the Sword Coast          at all. The exceptions are scimitars, which are definitely less exotic than          the other items and hence more plentiful.</p>
      <p>This component also fixes a known bug in the game, in that the merchant          at Gullykin and the Helm temple in Nashkel shared the same store file. </p>

<p>The modding community for the Infinity Engine has been going strong for          more than 15 years now, and is the culmination of thousands of unpaid modding          hours by fellow fans of the game. Modders produce their best work and players          get the best, well-supported mods when we all work together. </p>
  <p> There are two big ways to upset this harmony. One is to claim someone else's          work as your own. The second is to host and redistribute a mod without permission          from the author(s). </p>

    <div class="ribbon_triangle_h2-r"></div>
    <div class="section">
<p><strong>Version 3 - June 16, 2022</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Updated Russian translation, courtesy of paladin84 and <a href="https://arcanecoast.ru/">arcanecoast.ru</a></li>
  <li>Fixed a typo or two in the text</li>
  <li>Revamped translation files and how the mod handles encoding</li>
  <li>Fixed the French readme's encoding as it was not properly displaying some characters</li>
  <li>Minor changes for <strong>Exotic Items Pack</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Tsu-o-Shi now has its own, unique icon</li>
      <li>The Quiver/Case/Bag of Plenty will better match the projectiles and usability of their underlying items (e.g. shamans could not use the Quiver)</li>
      <li>The prices of  Ioun Stones has been reduced</li>
      <li>The Flickering White Ioun Stone now displays a portrait icon to go along with its cold resistance</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
<p><strong>Version 2 - February 8, 2022</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed a bug with <strong>The Calling</strong> component where the original Melicamp quest was not getting  closed out (XP, reputation, proper journal entries) on BGEE or EET games. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Version 1 - December 20, 2021</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Thanks to JohnBob for an updated French translation, as well as some proofreading of the original text</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug where Keldath's dialogue was making a non-sequitir (thanks Gwendolyne)</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug where Taerom would keep repeating his final line at the conclusion of the main Calling quest (thanks morpheus562)</li>
  <li>Fixed a pair of bugs where variables weren't being evaluated in scripts (thanks TotoR)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Beta 3 - October 12, 2021</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Added Polish translation (including for the mage quest) and a readme, courtesy of memory</li>
  <li>Additional PI integration</li>
  <li>When playing <strong>Peaceful Werewolf Isle Resolution</strong> on BGT, Kaishas would not give the Sea Charts to the player, nor would she (or the other werewolves) leave after the dialogue was complete</li>
  <li>Numerous fixes to the main component:
    <ul>
      <li>Angel provided several fixes for the subquest of helping Melicamp and the Nashkel miners</li>
      <li>Iris and Largo no longer take up permanent residence at the High Hedge</li>
      <li>Melicamp would sometimes not return from the Nashkel Mines, depending on how you resolved the issue with the miners</li>
      <li>Thalantyr had the wrong 'what to do' reply when asked after helping Iris due to some bad variable checks</li>
      <li>Taerom would not provide a new item at the conclusion due to misordered  triggers (if you opted for it), nor was he actually using the powder or bracers</li>
      <li>Thalantyr was erroneously bumping a variable after sending you to Taerom, meaning the first time you asked about Melicamp's whereabouts you received the 'you asked already' reply from Taerom</li>
      <li>The EEs run Melicamp's Anti-Chickenator cutscene slightly differently, so the change to make sure Melicamp survives was not working on the EEs</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Beta 2 - February 8, 2019</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixes for The Calling component:
          <ul>
            <li>The guaranteed black pearl has been moved from Sil, since various mods allow her to leave peacefully. It's been relocated to the cave she guards.</li>
            <li>The mage calling also adjusts Thalantyr's dialogue in a much mod-friendlier fashion. Previously the 'in-progress' dialogues could block needed dialogues from other mods. </li>
            <li>The cutscene that is supposed to follow the final bracer removal only played on Tutu games.</li>
            <li>In the sequence at the Nashkel mines where you helped Melicamp restore the memory of two miners, the dialogue from the miners still sometimes read as if the mines weren't yet cleared.</li>
            <li>Taerom's timer was not working properly since its scope was wrong. </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
<p><strong>Beta 1 - September 14, 2018</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Initial release</li>
      </ul>

      <p> First time installing a mod? Check out <abbr title="The Gibberlings Three">G3</abbr>&#39;s comprehensive tutorial: <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/topic/33164-a-new-player%E2%80%99s-guide-to-installing-and-playing-mods/">A New Player's Guide to Installing and Playing Mods</a>. </p>
      <p> <strong>Enhanced Editions Note</strong><br />
        The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game&#39;s folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages. </p>
      <p> <strong>Windows</strong><br />
        The Gavin NPC mod for Windows is distributed as a self-extracting archive and includes a <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr> installer. To install, simply double-click the archive and follow the instructions on screen. </p>
      <p> Alternatively, the files can be extracted into your game directory using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a> or <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-gavin_bg2.exe</strong> and the folder <strong>gavin_bg2</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-gavin_bg2.exe</strong> and follow the instructions on screen. </p>
      <p> You can run <strong>setup-gavin_bg2.exe</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components. </p>
      <p> <strong>macOS</strong><br />
        The Gavin NPC mod for macOS is distributed as a compressed tarball and includes a <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr> installer. </p>
      <p> First, extract the files from the tarball into your game directory. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-gavin_bg2</strong>, <strong>setup-gavin_bg2.command</strong>, and the folder <strong>gavin_bg2</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-gavin_bg2.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen. </p>
      <p> You can run <strong>setup-gavin_bg2.command</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components. </p>
      <p> <strong>Linux</strong><br />
        The Gavin NPC mod for Linux is distributed as a compressed tarball and does not include a <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr> installer. Linux users will need to do a one-time install of <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr> (and a few other adjustments) as described in <a href="https://moebiusproject.gitlab.io/mods_on_linux">this great writeup</a>. </p>
      <p> To install, run &#39;WeInstall gavin_bg2 in your game folder. </p>
      <p> <strong>Note for Complete Uninstallation</strong><br />
        In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely uninstall the mod using setup-gavin_bg2 --uninstall at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts. </p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The mod contains several components that can be installed independently
        of one another. </p>
      <p><strong>Gavin for BG2</strong> </p>
      <p>This is the main component that will add Gavin to your Baldur's Gate II game.
        He can be found in the Slums of Athkatla, in the Temple of Ilmater on the roof of the Copper Coronet. Gavin is a NG cleric of Lathander, and has the following statistics:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><acronym title="Strength">STR</acronym>: 16</li>
        <li><acronym title="Dexterity">DEX</acronym>: 12</li>
        <li><acronym title="Constitution">CON</acronym>: 16</li>
        <li><acronym title="Intelligence">INT</acronym>: 12</li>
        <li><acronym title="Wisdom">WIS</acronym>: 17</li>
        <li><acronym title="Charisma">CHR</acronym>: 12</li>
      </ul>
      <p>His biography is as follows:</p>
      <p class="kit_description">When asked about his past, Gavin tells you that it was fairly unremarkable. He was born to a sailmaker and a midwife in Ulgoth's Beard and has wanted to be a priest of Lathander since he was a boy. After several years of service to the Song of the Morning Temple in Beregost, he finally felt the lure of adventure.</p>
      <p> Gavin has frequent banters with the PC. These can be hushed by asking him. If you find his interjections annoying, these can be silenced as well, though he will always react to decisions that offend him.</p>
      <p>To continue a committed romance begun earlier, the PC will need to have met his requirements for romance in BG1: female, good-aligned, wisdom of 10 or better, charisma of 12 or better, and not an assassin, bounty hunter, or necromancer. To choose this option, you can recognize the ring you find in the opening dungeon, or you can acknowledge him as &quot;love&quot; in his joining dialogue. To begin a new romance in BG2, do not recognize the ring and avoid calling him &quot;love&quot; in his joining dialogue. In BG2, any female PC with both wisdom and charisma of 8 or better who is not an assassin may begin a new romance.</p>
      <p>If the PC is male and if Gavin knew him in BG, Gavin will have a short romance arc with Imoen after she is recruited in Spellhold.</p>
      <p><strong>Gavin heals the PC when below 50% health</strong><br />
        <em>Requires Gavin for BG2</em></p>
      <p>Some players appreciated the fact that Gavin would heal the PC when his or her health dropped below 50%, other players did not. Now the component is optional. Please note that if you install this component, you can disable the auto-heal behavior at any time through player-initiated dialogue, but if you don't install the component, he will only heal the PC if you select him and cast the spells manually.</p>
      <p><strong>Multi-romance cheat</strong><br />
        <em>Requires Gavin for BG2</em></p>
      <p>Applies only to Anomen and Edwin.</p>
      <p>You're on your 47th playthrough of BG2, and you really, really wish there was a way that you could get in as many romances as possible. Or maybe you're a saint in real life, but you'd like your pixelated alter-ego to live a more daring lifestyle. Either way, you would like to see all the conflict dialogues, but you don't want relationships to end over them. If you install &quot;No romance kills&quot; you can multi-romance to your heart's content. You'll still get all the conflict dialogues, and somebody may even say that the relationship is over, but it isn't. This component affects Romantic Encounter reactions, too. Gavin will complain, and you'll get the conflict dialogues, but a relationship will never end because you've got too many names on your dance card. If you mortally offend Gavin by telling him off bigtime or kick him out of the party in an exceptionally rude manner, the relationship will end, but it won't be because you were seeing someone else.</p>
      <p><strong>Alternate Portraits</strong><br />
        <em>Requires Gavin for BG2</em></p>
      <p>Gavin has <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/gallery/album/44-gavin-alternative-portraits/">six alternative portraits</a> that the player can select. </p>

<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<p>This mod is designed to work with  <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>: Shadows of Amn  with or without
  the  expansion pack Throne of Bhaal. There are no known incompatibilities. </p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Windows</strong><br />
      JPS' Portrait Pack is packaged and installed with <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> and is distributed as a self-extracting
      archive. To install, simply double-click the archive and follow the instructions on screen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternatively the files can be extracted from the archive using
      <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/">WinRAR</a>. If properly extracted, you should have an JPS_Portraits
      folder, Setup-JPS_Portraits.tp2 and Setup-JPS_Portraits.exe in your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder. To install, simply double-click
      Setup-JPS_Portraits.exe and follow the instructions on screen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please run Setup-JPS_Portraits.exe in your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change
      components.
    </p>
<p><strong>Mac OS X</strong> <br />
<em>If the mod was previously installed, uninstall it before extracting the new version. </em> JPS' Portrait Pack is packaged and installed with <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>. To install, simply extract the contents of the mod into your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder.&nbsp; If properly extracted, you should have a jpspp folder, Setup-JPS_Portraits.tp2, Setup-JPS_Portraits, and Setup-JPS_Portraits.command in your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder. To install, simply double-click <strong>Setup-JPS_Portraits.command </strong> and follow the instructions on screen. You'll receive a message informing you that <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> can not auto-update--don't worry, this is normal. </p>
<h2>Contents</h2>
<p>Each portrait is a separate component. In JPS' own words:</p>
<p>&quot;The first two portraits I blame on the <acronym title="Pocket Plane Group">PPG</acronym> flirt packs. One of the flirt options for Aerie is &quot;Stare down Aerie's robe&quot;, but if you look at her portrait you'll notice that her robe is of the non-stareable kind. So to get a deeper and more immersive roleplaying experience I made this. That's my story and I'm sticking to it!</p>
<p>(part of the picture is borrowed from a portrait from the Portrait Portal. I'll give it back if they ask)</p>
<p>My favourite flirt option for Jaheira is &quot;Play with Jaheira's braids&quot;. Unfortunately I got a bit carried away, so the 38x60 version that you see most in the game doesn't look that great. At the moment I'm using the second portrait instead.</p>
<p>I was allergic to headbands for a while, so I removed them from the Nalia and Viconia portraits. Then I started editing other things as well, and then my trial version copy of Photoshop stopped working. These two would be &quot;works in progress&quot; if I was planning to ever do anything about them. But since I probably won't they're just 'works in'.</p>
<p>And finally there's a picture of Imoen without the stuff in her hair and with an attempt at a smile.&quot;</p>

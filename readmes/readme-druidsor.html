    <div class="ribbon_triangle_h2-r"></div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>The Geomantic Sorcerer Kit is strongly based on the Druidic   Sorcerer Kit by Constant Gaw, and resurrected by hlidskialf and loosely   based on the Geomancer prestige class from the <acronym title="Advanced Dungeons and Dragons"> AD&amp;D</acronym> 3rd Edition Masters of the Wild manual. The kit combines the sorcerer's   spellcasting methods and spells with additional druidic spells and   abilities and features its own unique tiered <acronym title="High Level Ability">HLA</acronym> progression     and custom spells. </p>
      <p>On the Enhanced Editions of the games, the kit will appear during character generation as a sorcerer kit. For original BG2 (including BGT and Tutu), due to the limitations of the kit   selection interface the kit is not selectable at character creation,   but if the player meets the kit requirements Aataqah the genie at the   start of Chateau Irenicus might see fit to help the player remember   their abilities as a geomantic sorcerer. See the kit description below   for more details.</p>
      <p>The mod package also has the option to install an enhancement that lets the      player select a portrait for their Geomantic Sorcerer as well as portraits for      all of their basic druidic shape change animal forms: bear, cat, dog, leopard, moose,      panther, rat, snake, and wolf. </p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It is recommended that any previous versions of the Geomantic   Sorcerer Kit be uninstalled prior to installing a new version. This kit   should be installable at any point in mod installation without   conflicts.</p>
      <p> Enhanced Edition games support sorcerer kits, so you can select the kit at character creation.</p>
      <p>For original Baldur's Gate II, the mod currently requires      that the player start a new game in the Shadows of Amn segment, although      future versions will allow a player to start in Throne of Bhaal or Candlekeep      for <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym> and Tutu games.      This mod should be compatible with other <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> mods.</p>
      <p>The kit may be applied at any time in Tutu, <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym> and Throne      of Bhaal games by using the CLUAConsole to create the item CA#AGEO.itm and using      the item from the the protagonist's inventory. This method will only work for giving the kit      to the protagonist and will not work for assigning the kit to a <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>.      This is a temporary feature until I can code some proper dialog to apply the kit at other times in the game. </p>
      <p>When selecting a kit at character creation, the original BG2 is hardcoded      to display only nine choices. You can install more than nine kits, but only      the first nine installed will be offered as selections. If kits from other      mods are installed, please be aware of this limitation. The extra kits will      be available if they are assigned to enemies, but unavailable for character      creation.</p>
      <p>Players wishing to assign the kit to a <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> are advised to use the <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/lev1npcs/">Level 1 NPCs</a> mod.      Please note that players should not install the <strong>Portraits for Druidic Shapeshifting</strong> component      if they wish to assign the kit to a <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>.</p>

      <p> <strong>Special Note for Siege of Dragonspear from Steam/<abbr title="Good Old Games">GOG</abbr></strong><br />
        Good Old Games (<abbr title="Good Old Games">GOG</abbr>) and Steam both package the additional content for Siege of Dragonspear in a method that <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr>, the tool used to install this mod, cannot access. You must run a program called <a href="https://github.com/Argent77/A7-DlcMerger/releases"><abbr title="Downloadable Content">DLC</abbr> Merger</a> on your <abbr title="Siege of Dragonspear">SoD</abbr> installation before you can install this or any other <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr>-based mod. </p>
      <p> <strong>Enhanced Editions Note</strong><br />
        The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note   that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the   middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if   possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to   continue with your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's   folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game   patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language   version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod   will not show but give error messages. </p>
      <p> <strong>Windows</strong><br />
        The Geomantic Sorcerer Kit for Windows is distributed as a self-extracting archive and includes a <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr> installer. To install, simply double-click the archive and follow the instructions on screen. </p>
      <p> Alternatively, the files can be extracted into your game directory using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a> or <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-druidsor.exe</strong> and the folder <strong>druidsor</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-druidsor.exe</strong> and follow the instructions on screen. </p>
      <p> You can run <strong>setup-druidsor.exe</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components. </p>
      <p> <strong>macOS</strong><br />
        The Geomantic Sorcerer Kit for macOS is distributed as a compressed tarball and includes a <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr> installer. </p>
      <p> First, extract the files from the tarball into your game directory. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-druidsor</strong>, <strong>setup-druidsor.command</strong>, and the folder <strong>druidsor</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-druidsor.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen. </p>
      <p> You can run <strong>setup-druidsor.command</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components. </p>
      <p> <strong>Linux</strong><br />
        The Geomantic Sorcerer Kit for Linux is distributed as a compressed tarball and does not include a <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr> installer. Linux users will need to do a one-time install of <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr> (and a few other adjustments) as described in <a href="https://moebiusproject.gitlab.io/mods_on_linux">this great writeup</a>. </p>
      <p> To install, run 'WeInstall druidsor in your game folder. </p>
      <p> <strong>Note for Complete Uninstallation</strong><br />
        In addition to the methods above for removing individual   components, you can completely uninstall the mod using setup-druidsor   --uninstall at the command line to remove all components without wading   through prompts. </p>

      <p><strong>Geomantic Sorcerer</strong></p>
      <div class="kit_description">
        <p> GEOMANTIC SORCERER: The cleric reaches out to a higher power. The wizard        trusts only in eldritch tomes. The druid looks to nature for her spells.        To the geomantic sorcerer, however, all magic is the same. Geomancy is the        art of channeling magical energy from many sources through the land itself.        The spells he casts through his connections with the earth are reflections        of his own strength of will.</p>
        <p>Advantages:<br />
          - Learns druid spells in addition to sorcerer spells and casts them from          the sorcerer's spellbook.<br />
          - At level 8, can shapeshift into new druid animal forms, gains an additional        use every 3 levels.<br />
          - Can learn high level Quintessence Magic. <br />
          Quintessence Magic draws directly upon magic in its basic form, free of        intermediaries such as deities, the Weave, or structured spellcasting.        It is an inherently intuitive blending of the arcane and the natural forces        in the world and cannot be taught or granted.</p>
        <p>Disadvantages:<br />
          - Has a 15% penalty to experience.<br />
          - Strength, Constitution, and Dexterity have a -2 penalty.<br />
          - Has a penalty of 1 to casting speed.<br />
        </p>
        <p>Requirements:<br />
          - 13 Wisdom, 9 Charisma.<br />
          - Must be of any Neutral alignment.<br />
        </p>
        <p>Restrictions:<br />
          - Sorcerer Item usage.<br />
          - Recognized as a sorcerer.</p>

      <p><strong>Portraits for Druidic Shapeshifting</strong><br />
        <em>Not available for Enhanced Editions</em></p>
      <p>This component enhances the Geomantic Sorcerer's druidic shapeshifting spell to automatically        change the player's portrait whenever they turn into one of the animals.  Portraits can be        viewed by scrolling down or following <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/gallery/album/34-geomantic-sorcerer/">this link</a>.  Do not install this component        if you are planning on assigning the kit to a <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>. Because the Enhanced Editions use a larger default portrait size, this component is not available on these platforms. </p>

      <h3><strong>Druid Shapeshifting </strong></h3>
    </div>
    <div class="ribbon_triangle_h3-l"></div>
    <div class="ribbon_triangle_h3-r"></div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>The geomantic sorcerer also gains a slightly larger set of animal forms:</p>
      <p><strong>Bear</strong><br />
        A slow moving but powerful Brown Bear. (<acronym title="Armor Class">AC</acronym>6, <acronym title="To-Hit Armor Class Zero">THAC0</acronym> 13,      3 attacks per round-<acronym title="1 roll of a 6-sided die">1d6</acronym>)</p>
      <p><strong>Cat</strong><br />
        Even this small creature has its uses. If ever in need of nimble movement,        the druid can shapeshift into a cat and maneuver through obstacles as if        hasted and affected by Free Action. (<acronym title="Armor Class">AC</acronym>4, <acronym title="To-Hit Armor Class Zero">THAC0</acronym> 17,        1 attack per round-<acronym title="1 roll of a 2-sided die">1d2</acronym>)</p>
      <p><strong>Dog</strong><br />
        The Dog has little place in combat, but does possess great tracking abilities.        Its acute senses can easily locate traps and enemies. (<acronym title="Armor Class">AC</acronym>6, <acronym title="To-Hit Armor Class Zero">THAC0</acronym> 16,        1 attack per round-<acronym title="1 roll of a 4-sided die">1d4</acronym>)</p>
      <p><strong>Leopard</strong><br />
        Although similar to the Panther, the Leopard is a more consistent fighter.        It is better suited for fighting in well-lit areas. (<acronym title="Armor Class">AC</acronym>4, <acronym title="To-Hit Armor Class Zero">THAC0</acronym> 12,        2 attacks per round-<acronym title="1 roll of a 8-sided die">1d8</acronym>)</p>
      <p><strong>Moose</strong><br />
        A Moose can be a very dangerous foe when threatened. Although not the best        for direct damage, it can knock opponents unconscious and backwards with        its charge. (<acronym title="Armor Class">AC</acronym>7, <acronym title="To-Hit Armor Class Zero">THAC0</acronym> 13,        1 attack per round-<acronym title="1 roll of a 6-sided die">1d6</acronym>)</p>
      <p><strong>Panther</strong><br />
        A combination of stealth and power. The Panther can use a special stealth        attack each round with a 50% chance of success while outdoors. If successful,        the panther will be invisible for a short while and will do maximum damage        and attack with a +4 bonus to <acronym title="To-Hit Armor Class Zero">THAC0</acronym> for        one round. (<acronym title="Armor Class">AC</acronym>3, <acronym title="To-Hit Armor Class Zero">THAC0</acronym> 14,        2 attacks per round-<acronym title="1 roll of a 8-sided die">1d8</acronym>)</p>
      <p><strong>Rat</strong><br />
        Rats go unnoticed by most and are extremely hard to hit. If the druid is        in need for some stealthy movement, they can shapeshift into a rat to avoid        detection. (<acronym title="Armor Class">AC</acronym>16, <acronym title="To-Hit Armor Class Zero">THAC0</acronym> 20,        2 attacks per round-<acronym title="1 roll of a 2-sided die">1d2</acronym>,        90% physical resistances, invisibility, non-detection)</p>
      <p><strong>Snake</strong><br />
        This enormous Snake has a weak bite, but can inject its target with poisonous        venom with each hit. Those near it must also make a successful save versus        spells with a +4 bonus or flee in terror. (<acronym title="Armor Class">AC</acronym>4, <acronym title="To-Hit Armor Class Zero">THAC0</acronym> 15,        1 attack per round-<acronym title="1 roll of a 4-sided die">1d4</acronym>)</p>
      <p><strong>Wolf</strong><br />
        The Wolf is not a particularly powerful attacker. It compensates, however,        by being able to call in a pack of wolves (1-5 wolves, once per day) for        30 minutes, if outdoors. (<acronym title="Armor Class">AC</acronym>3, <acronym title="To-Hit Armor Class Zero">THAC0</acronym> 15,        1 attack per round-<acronym title="1 roll of a 8-sided die">1d8</acronym>)</p>

      <p>This spell summons an Orb of Pure Energy for 20 rounds. This Orb has many      abilities, both offensive and defensive, and its mere proximity to both friend      and foe has significant effect. The caster can shape its energy into many      different uses, but must remain within visual distance to maintain control.</p>
      <p>Close proximity to the orb will result in the following effects, occurring      once each round:</p>
      <p>Enemies:<br />
        Horror, Blindness, Ray of Enfeeblement, Remove Magic, Secret Word, Hold Monster,        Miscast Magic.</p>
      <p>All of these spells are cast identically to their wizard-spell counterparts      as though the Orb were a 25th level wizard. In addition, all creatures of      8 hit dice or lower are instantly slain, as per the 6th level wizard spell,      Death Spell.</p>
      <p>Allies:<br />
        All friendly creatures slowly regenerate when near the Orb. In addition,        they gain a bonus of 1 to their casting speed, a +1 bonus to all stats,        a bonus of 1 to all saving throws, and a bonus of 1 to their speed factor.</p>
      <p>The Orb is able to cast the following spells:</p>
      <p>Elemental Phasing (four times per day)<br />
        The Orb selects a target and sends 10 magical orbs flying at it. Each of        these orbs, upon hitting the target, will phase the victim briefly into        one of the 4 elemental planes for a split second before bringing them back.        These short forays will result in a small amount of elemental damage (<acronym title="1 roll of a 2-sided die">1d2</acronym>),        although at the end of the journey there is a 20% chance that the target        will be level drained (5 levels), feebleminded (4 rounds), or stunned (4        rounds) from the shock of travel. There is a 5% chance that the victim will        not be able to withstand the shock and will die instantly.</p>
      <p>Energy Shockwave (four times per day)<br />
        This spell sends all enemies near the orb flying backwards, dealing <acronym title="1 roll of a 20-sided die">1d20</acronym> points      of damage and slowing their movement rate by 75% for 1 round.</p>
      <p>Energy Exchange (four times per day)<br />
        All enemies within the selected radius will be struck by lightning bolts,        each dealing <acronym title="5 rolls of a 5-sided die">5d5</acronym> points        of damage.</p>
      <p>Ball Electricity (twenty times per day)<br />
        This is the Orb's basic attack which deals <acronym title="3 rolls of a 6-sided die">3d6</acronym> points      of electrical damage and <acronym title="3 rolls of a 6-sided die">3d6</acronym> points      of crushing damage to a single target. </p>

For 5 rounds, the caster gains complete immunity to magical damage, direct      magical effects, and magical weaponry. In addition, it grants the player      100% magic resistance and immunity to timestop. Because of the power of the      spell, all magical effects on the caster are dispelled upon casting, but      for the duration of the spell the player is free to cast spells both within      and outside of the shell. </p>

      <p><strong>Torrential Cacophony (TIER 4 ABILITY)</strong><br />
        <em>Requires: Earthly Planeswalking</em><br />
        (Quintessence Magic)<br />
        School: Any School<br />
        Range: Visual sight of caster<br />
        Duration: 3 rounds<br />
        Casting Time: 9<br />
        Area of Effect: 45-foot radius<br />
        Saving Throw: Special</p>
      <p>Harnessing the elemental powers of Air and Water, the    geomantic sorcerer  is able      to unleash an awesome display of magical might. A storm of ice, electricity,      and raging winds affecting everyone within a 30 foot radius, this spell is      second only to its sibling, Fiery Cataclysm, in pure destructive potential.      Although the mage must maintain concentration as he channels the spell and      will not be able to move from his location, he will be able to maintain enough      control to prevent any damage upon himself or his party.</p>
      <p>When cast, a massive lightning bolt comes down and strikes the sorcerer,      shrouding him in a field of electrical energy. At the precise moment of the      blast, lightning bolts fly out and strike everyone within range, dealing <acronym title="1 roll of a 10-sided die">1d10</acronym> points      of damage. Overhead, an Ice Storm will rage for 3 rounds. Every 4 seconds      (for a total of 5 times), it causes <acronym title="1 roll of a 8-sided die">1d8</acronym> points      of cold damage. Everyone caught in the storm will either be struck by a massive      Lightning Strike, a large Ice Boulder, or be swept up by a small Whirlwind,      once every 4 seconds (5 times maximum).</p>
      <p>The Lightning Strike does <acronym title="1 roll of a 15-sided die">1d15</acronym> points      of electrical damage and has a 75% chance of knocking all targets around      it backwards.</p>
      <p>The Ice Boulder deals <acronym title="2 rolls of a 10-sided die">2d10</acronym> points      of crushing damage and has a 50% chance of preventing its target from vocalizing      spells for 2 rounds and a 25% chance of knocking the target unconscious for      2 rounds.</p>
      <p>The Whirlwind deals <acronym title="1 roll of a 15-sided die">1d15</acronym> points      of slashing damage while simultaneously blowing its target back. There is      a 25% chance that the target will have his or her weapons blown off.</p>
      <p>During this storm, the caster becomes a conduit of electricity and water.      Each round, all enemies within the storm will either be struck by a Lightning      Bolt, a Smashing Wave of water, or a Cone of Cold.</p>
      <p>The Lightning Bolt behaves as a normal lightning bolt and does <acronym title="1 roll of a 10-sided die">1d10</acronym> points      of electrical damage. There is a 50% chance that the bolt will create an      Electrical Arc, which has a 50% chance to jump across all targets within      the vicinity. The Electrical Arc deals <acronym title="1 roll of a 5-sided die">1d5</acronym> points      of electrical damage to everyone it hits.</p>
      <p>The Smashing Wave strikes a single individual, dealing <acronym title="1 roll of a 20-sided die">1d20</acronym> points      of magical cold damage. This wave will wash the target back a good distance      and, cause the target to move at half-speed for 2 rounds.</p>
      <p>The Cone of Cold affects all enemies in its path, dealing <acronym title="1 roll of a 10-sided die">1d10</acronym> points      of cold damage. This blast has a 25% chance of freezing its targets for 1      round.</p>
      <p>There is no save. </p>
      <p><strong>Fiery Cataclysm (TIER 4 ABILITY)</strong><br />
        <em>Requires: Earthly Planeswalking</em><br />
        (Quintessence Magic)<br />
        School: Any School<br />
        Range: Visual sight of caster <br />
        Duration: 5 rounds<br />
        Casting Time: 9 <br />
        Area of Effect: 45-foot radius<br />
        Saving Throw: Special </p>
      <p> A devastating inferno of fire and rock that billows from the sky and grasps      from the earth. It is the single most destructive spell available and will      harm everything in its path save the caster. Fiery Cataclysm&rsquo;s power      rivals that of the Gods themselves, and has the potential to level small      villages, let alone its occupants. The effects of the spell are automatically      centered upon the caster for 6 rounds, but unlike other area effect spells,      Fiery Cataclysm will move with its caster from round to round. </p>
      <p> Once the initial incantation is finished, a massive column of flame will      strike the player, encasing him in a globe of fire while sending out a massive      explosion that deals out <acronym title="2 rolls of a 10-sided die">2d10</acronym> points      of damage in a 45-foot radius. Everyone caught in the blast will be knocked      backwards and will either be struck by a minor fireball for <acronym title="3 rolls of a 5-sided die">3d5</acronym> points      of damage or a ray of flame (<acronym title="2 rolls of a 10-sided die">2d10</acronym> x      2 points of damage, target is pushed back by the flames for 1 round.) Four      seconds after the first eruption, another column of flame will pour down,      creating an identical explosion. Three seconds later, an additional explosion      will erupt. A final explosion will follow five seconds later, and everyone      within range will be struck by a another minor fireball.</p>
      <p> At the start of the third round of the spell, the sky will begin to rain      meteors, causing all within range to take <acronym title="2 rolls of a 5-sided die">2d5</acronym> points      of damage for every round that they are caught in the hail. Each round, every      target will be struck by a massive meteor (<acronym title="3 rolls of a 5-sided die">3d5</acronym> points      of damage in a 30 foot radius) twice and be blown backwards and possibly      knocked unconscious (25% chance, save vs. spells w/ +4 bonus) for 1 round.</p>
      <p> By the fifth round, after the last meteor falls, the ground will begin      to shake violently for two rounds, throwing all creatures about for <acronym title="1 roll of a 10-sided die">1d10</acronym> points      of damage each round and causing flaming rifts to open on the ground twice      per round, crushing victims for <acronym title="2 rolls of a 8-sided die">2d8</acronym> points      of damage. Each round, the vegetation on the ground will also attempt to      grasp at any living creature and hold it rigidly for one round with a 50%      success rate.</p>
      <p> At the end of the sixth round, a final column of flame will engulf the      caster once again, sending out three massive fiery shockwaves that engulf      its victims for <acronym title="2 rolls of a 10-sided die">2d10</acronym> points      of damage each.</p>

      <p><strong>Cone of Freezing Cold (Evocation)</strong> <br />
        Level: 5<br />
        Range: 0 <br />
        Duration: Instantaneous <br />
        Casting Time: 5 <br />
        Area of Effect: Special <br />
        Saving Throw: 1/2</p>
      <p> When this spell is cast, it causes a cone-shaped area of extreme cold,      originating at the wizard's hand and extending outward in a cone five feet      long and one foot in diameter per level of the caster. It drains heat and      causes <acronym title="20 rolls of a 4-sided die">20d4</acronym> + 10 points      of damage, with a save for half damage. Every target that is within the enhanced      Cone of Cold's range must make an additional saving throw or be frozen for <acronym title="1 roll of a 4-sided die">1d4</acronym> rounds. </p>
      <p> <strong>Controlled Web (Evocation)</strong><br />
        Level: 2<br />
        Range: Visual sight of caster<br />
        Duration: 1 turn<br />
        Casting Time: 2 <br />
        Area of Effect: Special <br />
        Saving Throw: Special</p>
      <p> This spell is identical to its original incarnation with the notable exception      that it does not affect party members. A web spell creates a many-layered      mass of strong, sticky strands similar to spider webs but far larger and      tougher. The web spell covers a maximum area of about 30 feet in radius (roughly      the same size as a fireball). Creatures caught within webs, or simply touching      them, become stuck among the gluey fibers. Anyone in the area when the spell      is cast must roll a saving throw vs. spell with a -2 penalty. If the saving      throw is successful, then the creature is free to move out of the area. A      failed saving throw means the creature is stuck in the webs, unable to move.      Each round that a creature remains in the web, he must make a saving throw      or be unable to move. </p>
      <p> <strong>Delayed Blast Explosion (Invocation/Evocation)</strong> <br />
        Level: 7<br />
        Range: Visual range of caster<br />
        Duration: Special<br />
        Casting Time: 7<br />
        Area of Effect: 60' radius <br />
        Saving Throw: 3/4</p>
      <p> This spell creates a massive fireball that hovers at a point determined      by the caster. The fireball will stay in position until someone walks too      close to it, at which point it will explode for <acronym title="15 rolls of a 6-sided die">15d6</acronym> points      of damage with a save vs. spell for three-quarters damage. The resulting      explosion creates a massive expanding shockwave that stretches out in a 60-foot      radius. Its relatively slow expansion gives the caster and his party time      to flee. </p>
      <p> <strong>Immunity to Energy</strong> <br />
        (Abjuration) <br />
        Level: 8<br />
        Range: Touch <br />
        Duration: 1 round /level<br />
        Casting Time: 8<br />
        Area of Effect: Creature touched <br />
        Saving Throw: None </p>
      <p> When the spell is cast it confers 100% immunity against all energy attacks      such as fire, cold, acid, magic and electricity whether magical or non-magical      such as spells, weapons, wands, breath weapons, etc. This excludes any physical      attacks and spell-created weapons, such as Enchanted weapon and Spiritual      Hammer. In other words, any physical damage such as piercing, blunt or slashing      will get through. This effect lasts for the duration of the spell or until      dispelled. Multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative.</p>
      <p> <strong>Improved Ghost Armor (Conjuration/Summoning)</strong><br />
        Level: 3<br />
        Range: 0<br />
        Duration: 5 turns<br />
        Casting Time: 1 <br />
        Area of Effect: The caster<br />
        Saving Throw: None </p>
      <p> By means of this spell, the wizard creates a magical field of force that      serves as if it were field plate armor (<acronym title="Armor Class">AC</acronym> 2).      It is cumulative with Dexterity and, because of the enhanced nature of this      spell, with armor and shield bonuses. The armor spell does not hinder movement,      adds no weight or encumbrance, nor does it hinder spellcasting. It lasts      until successfully dispelled or until the duration expires. </p>
      <p> <strong>Major Globe of Invulnerability (Abjuration)</strong> <br />
        Level: 6<br />
        Range: 0 <br />
        Duration: 1 round/level <br />
        Casting Time: 6<br />
        Area of Effect: 5-foot-radius sphere <br />
        Saving Throw: None </p>
      <p> This spell is a more powerful version of Glove of Invulnerability, creating      an immobile, faintly shimmering magical sphere around the caster that prevents      any 1st-, 2nd-, 3rd- 4th- and 5th-level spell effects from penetrating (i.e.,      the area of effect of any such spells does not include the area of the globe      of invulnerability). This includes innate abilities and effects from devices.      However, any type of spell can be cast out of the magical sphere, and these      pass from the caster of the globe to their subject without affecting the      globe. Sixth and higher level spells are not affected by the globe. The globe      can be brought down by a successful dispel magic spell, as well as other      forms of magical attack such as Spellstrike and Pierce Magic. </p>
      <p><strong>Mordenkainen's Multiplicative Magic Missile (Evocation)</strong><br />
        Level: 1<br />
        Range: Visual range of caster <br />
        Duration: Variable <br />
        Casting Time: Variable <br />
        Area of Effect: 1 creature<br />
        Saving Throw: None </p>
      <p> Like the popular wizard spell, Magic Missile, this spell sends out accurate      missiles that inflict <acronym title="1 roll of a 4-sided die">1d4</acronym>+1      points of damage each. Unlike Magic Missile, Mordenkainen's Multiplicative      variant increases the possibilities for massive and minimal damage immensely. </p>
      <p> A successful casting of this spell only guarantees the creation of a single      magic missile, but at every step of the spell there is the possibility of      sending additional missiles at your enemy.</p>
      <p> 1 missile: 100%<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;+ 2 missiles: 75%<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ 3 missiles: 75%<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ 4 missiles: 66%<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ 5 missiles: 66%<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ 6 missiles: 50%<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ 7 missiles:  50%<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+  8 missiles: 33%<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+  9 missiles: 33%<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+  10 missiles: 25%<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+  Restart spell: 25%</p>
      <p> It is theoretically possible, if improbable, that this spell can repeat      itself an infinite number of times. In any case, the caster must maintain      concentration during the process, and thus the possibilities of the spell      may be brought to a halt by spell disruption. </p>
      <p> <strong>Otiluke's Consistently Resilient Sphere (Alteration)</strong><br />
        Level: 4<br />
        Range: 0<br />
        Duration: 1 turn<br />
        Casting Time: 4<br />
        Area of Effect: Target creature<br />
        Saving Throw: None</p>
      <p> When this spell is cast, the result is a globe of shimmering force that      encloses the subject creature. The resilient sphere will contain its subject      for the duration of the spell. The sphere is completely immune to all damage.      Actually, the only method of removing the sphere is a successful dispel magic.      Hence the creature caught inside the globe is completely safe from all attacks,      but at the same time is completely unable to affect the outside world. Unlike      the original variant of this spell, this spell cannot be saved against.</p>
      <p><strong>Summon Shambling Mound (Conjuration/Summoning) </strong><br />
        Level: 9<br />
        Range: Visual sight of caster <br />
        Duration: 5 hours<br />
        Casting Time: 7 <br />
        Area of Effect: Special <br />
        Saving Throw: None </p>
      <p>Upon casting, a powerful mound of earth and tree and rock will rise out      of the ground. The mound will do the bidding of the caster until it is slain,      or the duration of the spell runs out. All of the commands given to the elemental      are done telepathically so there is no time lost due to miscommunication,      and no need to know the language of the summoned creature. </p>
      <p><strong>Tornado (Invocation)</strong><br />
        Level: 9<br />
        Range: Visual sight of caster <br />
        Duration: 5 rounds<br />
        Casting Time: 7 <br />
        Area of Effect: 30-foot radius<br />
        Saving Throw: Special </p>
      <p>When cast, a whirlwind appears at the selected spot for 5 rounds. Twice      per round, all enemies within a 30 foot radius must make a successful saving      throw against each of the following possible effects:</p>
      <p>Wing Buffet: Save vs. Breath or be blown back a great distance.<br />
        Dropped Weapons: Save vs. Breath or have your weapons blown off.<br />
        Flying Debris: Save vs. Spells at a +2 bonus or be knocked unconscious by      flying debris for 3 rounds.<br />
        Strong Winds: Save vs. Breath at a -4 penalty or have one's movement rate      slowed to 25% for 1 round.</p>
      <p>Twice per round, all victims will take <acronym title="2 rolls of a 10-sided die">2d10</acronym> points      of damage from being slammed into the ground or hit by flying objects. A      successful save vs. breath will reduce the damage by half. </p>
      <p><strong>Wave Spray (Invocation/Evocation)</strong><br />
        Level: 1<br />
        Range: Visual range of caster<br />
        Duration: Instantaneous <br />
        Casting Time: 2 <br />
        Area of Effect: Target creature<br />
        Saving Throw: Special</p>
      <p>When the geomantic sorcerer casts this spell, a small wave of water will      fly out and strike the target for <acronym title="1 roll of a 8-sided die">1d8</acronym> points      of damage. The crash of the wave will affect those around it in a 20 foot      radius, causing 1 point of damage to each affected creature unless a save      vs. spells is made at a +3 bonus. </p>

      <p>This section largely owes it's existence to the fine work of Amaurea who was very
        obliging in transforming 30 different portraits of animals into &quot;Baldurized&quot; versions.
        In addition to this excellent work, Amaurea was also kind enough to allow me to borrow
        a number of her more traditional, previously published, humanoid portraits.  You can see
        more of Amaurea's work at her website at <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/amaurea62/">http://www.freewebs.com/amaurea62/</a>.</p>
      <p>Additionally, Amedyr answered a general request to forum users at <a href="gibberlings3.net/forums">The Gibberlings Three</a> and came up with an original interpretation of the Geomantic Sorcerer archetype; thank you Amedyr.</p>
      <p>The remaining portraits were collected along my journeys through a multitude of
        &quot;Baldur's Gate&quot; portrait websites and forums, and as I didn't make note of their
        artist's at the time I can not give credit directly.  I would still offer a thank
        you to their artists all the same.</p>

    Three Mod</a><br />
    Author: Eric Kerr (aka Cirerrek)</strong></p>
  <p><strong> Version 1.2 - <a href="http://gibberlings3.net/forums/index.php?app=downloads&amp;showcat=25">Check
    for the most recent version</a></strong></p>
</div>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>Like the <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/cirerrek/eseries.php">eSeries</a> for <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>,
    tSeries is a set of Player <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> scripts
    for Planescape: Torment. The basis for these scripts comes
    from Gebhard Blucher's Planescape: Torment Player <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> Scripts.
    I borrowed the scripts that he created and expanded upon
    them so that they are a bit more comprehensive in terms of
    spell usage and item usage.</p>
  <p>I have used the scripts to complete the game. They were
    tested with all of the <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> except
    Ignus. The scripts appear to function well, given the limits
    of this version of the scripting language. While I thoroughly
    enjoyed playing Planescape: Torment, I probably don't plan
    on another run through. That being the case, unless there
    are any major bugs in the scripts, this will probably be
    the final version that I assemble. If you like the scripts
    and want to improve or expand upon them, the source code
    is included in the download, so feel free to modify them
    however you would like. I would just ask that you please
    credit Gebhard Blucher and I if you place the scripts up
    for public download. </p>
  <p>The scripting language in Planescape: Torment is definitely
    limited in comparison to the scripting commands available
    in some of the more recent <acronym title="Infinity Engine">IE</acronym> games,
    but the language still allows for the automation of some
    tasks, like spell casting, item usage, attacking, and hiding
    in shadows. The scripts will target the nearest enemy and
    attack them by whatever means they have available and deem
    appropriate based on experience point checks of their nearest
    foe.</p>
  <p>The scripts make liberal use of ActionListEmpty(), which
    means that if you tell them to do something, they will do
    it rather than following their scripted commands. There is
    one exception to this rule and that is in the case where
    a character(s) is low in hitpoints and still under attack.
    In this case, they will run away from their attacker for
    a set period of time. If you want the character to stay in
    combat despite their injuries, you will need to get them
    healed or turn off the party <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym>.
    One other item of note is for Annah or <acronym title="The Nameless One">TNO</acronym> to
    automatically hide in shadows, they must have a Stealth skill
    of at least 75%; otherwise, this function will not be activated.</p>
</div>

<h2>Contents</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>The basis for these scripts comes from Gebhard Blucher's
    Planescape: Torment Player <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> Scripts.
    I borrowed the scripts that he created and expanded upon
    them so that they are a bit more comprehensive in terms of
    spell usage and item usage.</p>
  <p>The pack contains both the .baf and the .bcs files for the
    scripts, as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>PCANNAH</li>
    <li> PCDAKKON</li>
    <li> PCGRACE</li>
    <li> PCIGNUS</li>
    <li> PCMORTE</li>
    <li> PCNAME</li>
    <li> PCNORDOM</li>
    <li> PCVHAIL</li>
    <li> 0110CUT1 - this is a fix file created by Gebhard Blucher
      which properly assigns Annah's script upon her joining
      the party</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I have used the scripts to complete the game. They were
    tested with all of the <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> except
    Ignus. The scripts appear to function well, given the limits
    of this version of the scripting language. While I thoroughly
    enjoyed playing Planescape: Torment, I probably don't plan

    the final version that I assemble. If you like the scripts
    and want to improve or expand upon them, the source code
    is included in the download, so feel free to modify them
    however you would like. I would just ask that you please
    credit Gebhard Blucher and me if you place the scripts up
    for public download.</p>
  <p><strong>Known Issues:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li> For some reason, The Nameless One (<acronym title="The Nameless One">TNO</acronym>)
      appears to 'space out' from time to time and I have not
      been able to determine why. The 'spacing out' does not
      affect any of the other <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym>,
      which is part of the reason the problem has me baffled,
      as his script isn't really all that much more complicated
      than the scripts for the other <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym>.</li>
    <li> <acronym title="The Nameless One">TNO</acronym> is a
      rather unique character in that he can change classes during
      the course of the game. This causes a problem with the
      scripts in that <acronym title="The Nameless One">TNO</acronym> can
      still cast spells that he has memorized as a mage, even
      when he is currently not a mage. Some may find this a rather
      nifty loophole and others might be adverse to allowing <acronym title="The Nameless One">TNO</acronym> to
      continue to cast spells even while not a mage. Currently
      I have left it so that he can cast spells no matter his
      class. If there are enough calls for the feature, I believe
      I can use Class(Myself, MAGE) checks to prevent <acronym title="The Nameless One">TNO</acronym> from
      spell casting while not a Mage. </li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>Script Features</strong></p>
  <p>The scripting language in Planescape: Torment is definitely
    limited in comparison to the scripting commands available
    in some of the more recent <acronym title="Infinity Engine">IE</acronym> games,
    but the language still allows for the automation of some
    tasks, like spell casting, item usage, attacking, and hiding
    in shadows. The scripts will target the nearest enemy and
    attack them by whatever means they have available and deem
    appropriate based on experience point checks of their nearest
    foe. The experience scale the scripts use for spell targeting
    breaks down in the following manner:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>9th: &gt;1800 <acronym title="Experience Points">XP</acronym> </li>
    <li>8th: &gt;1600 <acronym title="Experience Points">XP</acronym> </li>
    <li>7th: &gt;1400 <acronym title="Experience Points">XP</acronym> </li>
    <li>6th: &gt;1200 <acronym title="Experience Points">XP</acronym> </li>
    <li>5th: &gt;1000 <acronym title="Experience Points">XP</acronym> </li>
    <li>4th: &gt;800 <acronym title="Experience Points">XP</acronym> </li>
    <li>3rd: &gt;600 <acronym title="Experience Points">XP</acronym> </li>
    <li>2nd: &gt;400 <acronym title="Experience Points">XP</acronym> </li>
    <li>1st: &gt;200 <acronym title="Experience Points">XP</acronym></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Melee and Missile attacks are handled on a nearest enemy
    basis and do not rely on the experience scale.</p>
  <p>Finally, the scripts make liberal use of ActionListEmpty(),
    which means that if you tell them to do something, they will
    do it rather than following their scripted commands. There
    is one exception to this rule and that is in the case where
    a character(s) is low in hitpoints and still under attack.
    In this case, they will run away from their attacker for
    a set period of time. If you want the character to stay in
    combat despite their injuries, you will need to get them
    healed or turn off the party AI. One other item of note is
    for Annah or <acronym title="The Nameless One">TNO</acronym> to
    automatically hide in shadows, they must have a Stealth skill
    of at least 75%; otherwise, this function will not be activated. </p>

    <li>Added Rod of Modron Might to t_Items_Defensive </li>
    <li>Added Cockroach Charm to t_Items_Defensive </li>
    <li>In CLERIC_CALL_LIGHTNING Changed !Range(LastSeenBy(Myself),10)
      to !Range(LastSeenBy(Myself),8) because it was never being
      cast at !Range(LastSeenBy(Myself),10). I'll try this but
      might just have to bite the bullet and let the other <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> get zapped by the spell if I want it cast at all. May be
      the same way for all the AOE spells. WIZARD_FIRE_AND_ICE
      also does some collateral damage, but not a whole lot. </li>

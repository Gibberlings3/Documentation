      <p>The <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">EE</acronym> Fixpack is a <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> compilation
        of fixes for the Enhanced Editions of Baldur's Gate, Baldur's Gate II, Icewind Dale, and Planescape: Torment. This collaborative effort, including the work of modders from several different
        modding communities, is intended to address issues left over in these games after the current official patch. At the time of this release, the current, officially patched versions for the games are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Planescape: Torment; v3.1.4.0</li>
        <li>Other games: v2.6.6.0</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As we approach a stable release, there will eventually be  a need to introduce
        and test new fixes. To facilitate these new fixes without compromising the
        stability of the project, a component entitled <strong>Beta Core Fixes</strong> will be 
        available. This component includes fixes intended for the Core Fixes component
        and tested in a limited fashion, but have not yet been tested 'in the wild'
        or with other mods. <strong>As such, this component is considered to be of
        a beta status regardless if the mod is at a stable release.</strong> As fixes in this component get tested and validated
        in the wild, they will move into the Core Fixes. </p>
      <p>The <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">EE</acronym> Fixpack strives for complete transparency  in its fixes. As such, complete documentation (<a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/subpages/ee-fixpack/docs_bgee/">BGEE/SoD</a>, <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/subpages/ee-fixpack/docs_bg2ee/">BG2EE</a>, <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/subpages/ee-fixpack/docs_iwdee/">IWDEE</a>, <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/subpages/ee-fixpack/docs_pstee/">PsTEE</a>) is available of the fixes on the project pages, visual fixes are noted in the <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/gallery/album/41-enhanced-edition-fixpack/"><acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">EE</acronym> Fixpack Gallery</a>, and  all discussions leading up to fixes are in the <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/forum/232-ee-fixpack/">EE Fixpack forum</a>.

      <p>The EE Fixpack is designed to work with the Enhanced Editions of Baldur's Gate (with or witout the Siege of Dragonspear expansion), Baldur's Gate II, Icewind Dale, or Planescape: Torment. <strong>In terms of installation order, the
        Fixpack should be installed after the official patches, but before other
        mods with the sole exception for DLC Merger, as noted in the installation instructions. </strong></p>
      <p>There are also <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/topic/34892-code-code-fixes-aka-stuff-we-cant-fix/">some bugs we can't fix</a>, that we hope can be addressed in a future official patch. </p>
      <p>As <abbr title="Enhanced Edition Fixpack">EEFP</abbr> is in development, and because this it goes first in the install order, we anticipate that other mods may report install warnings, or even fail to install. Please report these issues to the mod authors and to the <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/forum/232-ee-fixpack/">Fixack forum</a> so that we can work together to address incompatibilities. The most updated list of incompatibilities and their workarounds can be <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/topic/39382-the-compatibility-thread/">found in this thread</a>. </p>

      <p>The Fixpack in particular needs feedback and bug reports from players&mdash;not just for bugs in the game, but bugs that may be in the Fixpack itself. Discussion to identify bugs and the best way to fix them is important to the health of the Fixpack, so please join us on the <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/forum/232-ee-fixpack/">forums</a>!. Even if you're not sure if a bug is from the game itself, the EE Fixpack, or one of your other mods, please report it. It's better to have reports that turn out to be false positives than none at all. In addition, EE Fixpack is <a href="https://github.com/Gibberlings3/EE_Fixpack">available on GitHub</a>, so fixes and changes can be submitted by the community. </p>

      <p> First time installing a mod? Check out <abbr title="The Gibberlings Three">G3</abbr>&#39;s comprehensive tutorial: <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/topic/33164-a-new-player%E2%80%99s-guide-to-installing-and-playing-mods/">A New Player&rsquo;s Guide to Installing and Playing Mods</a>. </p>
      <p> <strong>Special Note for Siege of Dragonspear from Steam/<abbr title="Good Old Games">GOG</abbr></strong><br />
        Good Old Games (<abbr title="Good Old Games">GOG</abbr>) and Steam both package the additional content for Siege of Dragonspear in a method that <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr>, the tool used to install this mod, cannot access. You must run a program called <a href="https://github.com/Argent77/A7-DlcMerger/releases"><abbr title="Downloadable Content">DLC</abbr> Merger</a> on your <abbr title="Siege of Dragonspear">SoD</abbr> installation before you can install this or any other <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr>-based mod. </p>
      <p> <strong>Enhanced Editions Note</strong><br />
        The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game&#39;s folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages. </p>
      <p> <strong>Windows</strong><br />
        The EE Fixpack for Windows is distributed as a self-extracting archive and includes a <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr> installer. To install, simply double-click the archive and follow the instructions on screen. </p>
      <p> Alternatively, the files can be extracted into your game directory using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a> or <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-eefixpack.exe</strong> and the folder <strong>eefixpack</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-eefixpack.exe</strong> and follow the instructions on screen. </p>
      <p> You can run <strong>setup-eefixpack.exe</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components. </p>
      <p> <strong>macOS</strong><br />
        The EE Fixpack for macOS is distributed as a compressed tarball and includes a <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr> installer. </p>
      <p> First, extract the files from the tarball into your game directory. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-eefixpack</strong>, <strong>setup-eefixpack.command</strong>, and the folder <strong>eefixpack</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-eefixpack.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen. </p>
      <p> You can run <strong>setup-eefixpack.command</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components. </p>
      <p> <strong>Linux</strong><br />
        The EE Fixpack for Linux is distributed as a compressed tarball and does not include a <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr> installer. Linux users will need to do a one-time install of <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr> (and a few other adjustments) as described in <a href="https://moebiusproject.gitlab.io/mods_on_linux">this great writeup</a>. </p>
      <p> To install, run &#39;WeInstall eefixpack in your game folder. </p>
      <p> <strong>Note for Complete Uninstallation</strong><br />
        In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely uninstall the mod using setup-eefixpack --uninstall at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts. </p>

      <p>The <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">EE</acronym> Fixpack is basically
        three items: core fixes, a game text update, and beta core fixes. As the overall project is beta, the 'beta core fixes' component is not yet available. </p>
      <p><strong><acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">EE</acronym> Fixpack: Core Fixes </strong></p>
      <p> This component includes all fixes deemed to be core by the Fixpack team.
        While some bugs are clearly bugs, the team also has a review process for
        'gray area' bugs to insure that fixes do not contradict developer intent.
        The result is a 'core fixes' component which aims to address true bugs
        only and in a manner consistent with BioWare and Beamdog's original goals.  Complete
        documentation (<a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/subpages/ee-fixpack/docs_bgee/">BGEE/SoD</a>, <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/subpages/ee-fixpack/docs_bg2ee/">BG2EE</a>, <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/subpages/ee-fixpack/docs_iwdee/">IWDEE</a>, <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/subpages/ee-fixpack/docs_pstee/">PsTEE</a>) is available on the <acronym title="The Gibberlings Three">G3</acronym> web site. Additionally, the complete <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/forum/232-ee-fixpack/">Fixpack
        forums</a> are open, so if you want to see the reasoning behind a bugfix
        (or tell us we've got it all wrong), please join us on the forums and provide
        feedback. If you find a bug that is not fixed and  not already on our radar, please report it.</p>
      <p class="deprecated"><strong>Beta Core Fixes</strong><br />
        <em>Not yet available</em></p>
      <p class="deprecated">Once the mod, as a whole, leaves beta, this component will be used as a testing ground. This component includes fixes intended for the Core Fixes component and   tested in a limited fashion, but have not yet been tested 'in the wild'   or with other mods. <strong>As such, this component is considered to be of
        a beta status regardless if the mod is at a stable release.</strong> As fixes in this component get tested and validated in the wild, they will move into the Core Fixes. These fixes are shown in red on the documentation pages. </p>
      <p><strong>Game Text Update (GTU)</strong><br />
        <em>Availability based on language and game</em></p>
      <p>The Game Text Update seeks to correct textual errors, such as typos or grammar, that do not rise to the level of a bug. For example, an item listing the wrong damage would be fixed as part of the Core Fixes, whereas a typo in the description of the item would go here, especially as grammar and typos are generally language-specific. </p>

      <p> The modding community for the Infinity Engine has been going strong for
        more than 20 years now, and is the culmination of thousands of unpaid modding
        hours by fellow fans of the game. Modders produce their best work and players
        get the best, well-supported mods when we all work together. </p>
      <p> There are two big ways to upset this harmony. One is to claim someone else's

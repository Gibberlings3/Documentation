      <h2> Overview </h2>
    </div>
    <div class="ribbon_triangle_h2-l"></div>
    <div class="ribbon_triangle_h2-r"></div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>This is a <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> mod which
        adds a joinable <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> from <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym>,
        Kivan, and under certain circumstances, his elven wife, Deheriana, to the cast
        of <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> actors. </p>
      <p>The mod assumes that Kivan was in the group at the end of <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym>. The Archer will be looking for you in the Promenade District of Athkatla, having tracked you down this far from Baldur's Gate after you abduction. Once in the party, Kivan will interact with both the <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym> and the <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym>. If the <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym> is female, choosing certain dialogue options will hint at her interest in Kivan as a romanceable character. In this case, Deheriana's arc of the story would not occur, and a few flirtatious talks will appear after visiting Spellhold. </p>
      <p>If the <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym> is male or not interested in capturing Kivan's heart, Deheriana's story arc will develop in the end of the game. To see the story in full, please do not miss the talks with Aphril, Demin and Ellesime (in the end of the game). A happy ending for Deheriana's story will occur if Aerie or Cernd are in the party, or if the <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym> is one of the healing classes (Ranger, Druid, Cleric or Paladin) </p>
      <p>Kivan and Deheriana <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> have both <acronym title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</acronym> and <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym> content, such as dialogues with the <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym> and the <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>s, interjections into the game events, additional encounters, and Player-Initiated Dialogues.</p>
      <p><b>Deheriana</b></p>
      <p>Deheriana is a &#8220;hidden&#8221; <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> in this mod. Basically she can be summoned in Suldanessellar, while talking to Demin. Depending on the options you selected on install, Deheriana will be a Cleric-Mage-Fighter, an Enchanter, a Diviner or a Wild Mage. Her content will not be affected by her class selection.</p>
      <p> Deheriana is intended as a <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>, with only a short story-arc occurring in <acronym title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</acronym>. At present, Cernd, Aerie and Kivan will &#8220;bombard&#8221; Deheriana with chats when she joins the party, and she will talk once to the <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym> during a 30 minutes interval upon her joining. The outcome of those talks will decide
        her fate.</p>
      <p> She will either die in 30 minutes or during the congratulatory speech from Ellesime (whichever comes first), or she will be &#8220;restored&#8221;, an event which manifests itself in the increase of some of her stats and an <acronym title="Experience Points">XP</acronym> bonus that adjusts to the party level to make Deheriana roughly equal in <acronym title="Experience Points">XP</acronym> to
        the <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym>.&nbsp; </p>
      <table summary="Deheriana stat table">
        <tr>
          <th>Deheriana</th>
          <th>Initial Stats </th>
          <th>&quot;Restored&quot; Stats </th>

      </table>
      <p>After this transformation, both Kivan and Deheriana will follow the <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym> to <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym> and function as <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym>, bantering and interjecting throughout the game.</p>
      <p><b>Kivan&#8217;s Romance Guide</b></p>
      <p> &#8216;A thought spoken out loud is a lie.&#8217;</p>
      <p> It was not easy to write. The parchment tried to roll up all the time. Her knees were way too pointy to write on. The inkwell did not stand straight on the ground. The buzzing mosquitoes targeted her eyes, and nose, and ears. The light of the fire was dying down. </p>
      <p> <i>These are excuses. </i></p>
      <p> What mattered, what prevented her from writing, was the lack of words.</p>
      <p> ***</p>
      <p> And so I did write this romance for Baldur&#8217;s Gate, against, I must say, the better judgment. This walk-through is intended to give you a few tips and all the information I can think of to make the playing experience with Kivan&#8217;s Romance less frustrating. The romance is hard to maintain, and what seems logical to me could be out of the left field to you. It&#8217;s normal. We all have a different vision, and contradicting a player&#8217;s individual vision is a risk one takes when he or she starts to develop custom content for the existing characters. First and foremost, this mod is a work of fan-fiction. It is my version of the events, and if you think differently, this by no means supersedes your opinion. Nevertheless, understandably, I have heavily invested my own ideas and understanding of the character in this romance.</p>
      <p><b>Character Profile</b></p>

      In the original Baldur's Gate game, he can be found in the forest surrounding High Hedge, a tower of a reclusive mage. He joins the protagonist to hunt the bandits harassing the Sword Coast, since their leader, Tazok, killed his wife, Deheriana. As the conspiracy of <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> is unveiled, it becomes clear that Sarevok, Charname&#8217;s own mortal enemy, is Tazok's employer. In the end, Charname and his party destroy both.
      <p> After the events of <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym>, Kivan departed for his native elven forest, Shilmista, but hearing that Charname is missing, he tried to track his friend and ally down. That&#8217;s how he ends up in the Promenade in Athkatla, relieved and excited to see Charname relatively unharmed.</p>
      <p> Kivan is a tired, suffering man, who is held to the Prime Material Plane first by his desire to avenge Deheriana - his love, and then by the loyalty he feels toward Charname. Both his deep and true love for Deheriana and friendship with Charname are corner stones of the character development, and can be neither ignored, nor taken out. It was my intent to show a man who is ready to be your friend till the end of his time if necessary, but who loves another woman and hopes to be reunited with her as soon as his day job is done. He is an older person, but his views are not rigid - he is to a degree affected by the chaotic streak in his nature and the primeval yearning for justice. He is a man who makes mistakes and will, if not checked, follow his desires to the wrong choices in difficult situations. His advice during the game won&#8217;t be always right either. He will sometimes change his mind, or apologize if he spoke in favor of something that turned out badly.</p>
      <p> In vein with the above, do not expect a perfect romance, where the boy meets fair Charname and falls for her on the spot, courts her and does not ever want to part, ever and forever, and fights every man who looks her way to the death.</p>
      <p> It&#8217;s a romance built on both tragedy and friendship, which, if not pursued with determination and almost despair, will be a friendship.</p>
      <p> <b>Tragedy</b></p>
      <p> For Kivan to even think of another woman, Deheriana has to be utterly destroyed. Among the elves of Faerun, death is not the same thing as what we know of. Death for an elf is a departure to the world of Arvanaith, where an elf gets all of his wishes fulfilled and lives happily ever after. However, if death was too violent and occurred too far from the elven lands, the elf is destroyed completely. That&#8217;s what will happen to Deheriana, but Kivan would not know that unless he was told by an authority he&#8217;d believe. I use the seer, Aphril, in Spellhold to break the news. Hence, it is paramount to let Kivan talk to her if you&#8217;d like to romance him.</p>
      <p> Deheriana&#8217;s death is not enough, though.</p>
      <p> <b>Friendship</b></p>
      <p> I wrote the romance for a Charname who knows very well that she loves Kivan, and who will be a strong enough person to acknowledge this unreturned love. To acknowledge and to throw it on the scale when needed. Yes, the romance is from the &#8216;therapeutical&#8217; family, but it is not a one way street. You will see Kivan worry and fuss over Charname&#8217;s trials as much as Charname fusses over his. That&#8217;s what friends do.</p>
      <p> <b>Romance Conditions</b></p>
      <p> You need to be a female, with reputation above 11, and Deheriana must die (see the discussion on P#KivanLove below). I initially had racial restrictions, but if there is a romance least preoccupied with how Charname looks, as compared to what is in her heart, that&#8217;s Kivan&#8217;s. As a result, I couldn&#8217;t see how I could deny having feelings for Kivan to a dwarven or a half-orc woman.</p>
      <p> <b>Romantic Phases</b></p>
      <p> There are three easily distinguished phases in Kivan&#8217;s romance: <acronym title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</acronym> prior to talking to Aphril, <acronym title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</acronym> after talking to Aphril and <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym>.</p>
      <p> <acronym title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</acronym> prior to talking to Aphril is the stage where you define your relationship with Kivan. You can remain friends, and experience the mod that way - he has plenty of friendship content, and you can even resurrect Deheriana. If you do want to kindle the flames, so to speak, you do need to take it further. </p>
      <p><strong> P#KivanLove </strong></p>
      <p> is an index that tracks if Kivan is aware of your affection. This variable needs to be above 2 for Deheriana to die and open the romantic path, and above 9 for the relation to be strong enough to prevent Kivan&#8217;s departure in the end of <acronym title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</acronym> and for the romance to be carried over into <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym>. </p>
      <p> It is relatively easy to accumulate the P#KivanLove: try to select the ultimate caring responses, or responses that describe Charname&#8217;s feelings as romantic. Not having other romantic interests (or breaking up the relationships before they become committed) is also important. </p>
      <p> <acronym title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</acronym> after talking to Aphril is the stage in which a fragile and tender relationship forms. It culminates with the Tree of Life talk (which becomes an important emotional point) and Kivan&#8217;s short dialogue in the Nine Hells.</p>
      <p> The <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym> part is all about Kivan establishing himself as Charname&#8217;s lover, and - if desired - the love of her life.</p>
      <p> <b>Other Romances</b></p>
      <p> As noted above, Kivan in <acronym title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</acronym> is sensitive to other romances being run by the Player. If another romance is interrupted before it became committed, this will not influence Kivan&#8217;s Romance adversely. Please note that there is cumulative effect to having a few non-committed romances to run in parallel with Kivan&#8217;s. The important variables checks are when talking to Aphril and at the Tree of Life. </p>
      <p> Allowing any other romance to become committed will most probably preclude
        Kivan&#8217;s.</p>

Alternatively, copy the whole game&#39;s folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages. </p>

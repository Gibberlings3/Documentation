<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>One of the many fantastic things about Icewind Dale was the time the writers
    took in their item descriptions. This mod started by reading various item
    descriptions and trying to tell more of their story.</p>
  <p>The scope of the mod is fairly modest, as only 11 items are eligible for
    upgrade. Six items, based on Baldur's Gate II, are also available. </p>
</div>
<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>The components work with or without the expansions Heart of Winter and Trials
    of the Luremaster. This mod makes interactive changes and therefore should
    be compatible with other mods, and at present there are no known incompatibilities. While the Icewind Dale Tweak Pack is generally
    recommended to be installed last, this mod will detect and apply appropriate
    changes if it is installed after Tweaks. </p>
  <p>A <a href="http://gibberlings3.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=24870">good rundown of install order and incompatibilities</a> for several common Icewind Dale mods is available on the forums. </p>
  <p>As of version 3, this mod also works on the <a href="http://gibberlings3.net/forums/index.php?showforum=155">Icewind Dale in Baldurs Gate II</a> project, currently at beta v7. </p>
</div>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p><strong>Windows</strong><br />
    Item Upgrade for <acronym>Icewind Dale</acronym> is packaged and installed
    with <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> and is distributed
    as a self-extracting archive. To install, simply double-click the archive
    and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
  <p>Alternatively the files can be extracted from the archive using <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/">WinRAR</a>.
    If properly extracted, you should have an iu_iwd folder and setup-iu_iwd.exe
    in your <acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym> or <acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym>-in-<acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder. To install, simply
    double-click setup-iu_iwd.exe and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
  <p>Please run setup-iu_iwd.exe in your <acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym> or <acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym>-in-<acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder
    to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
  <p><strong>Mac OS X</strong><br />
    <em>If the mod was previously installed, uninstall it before extracting the
    new version.</em> Item Upgrade for <acronym>Icewind Dale</acronym> is packaged
    and installed with <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>.
    To install, simply extract the contents of the mod into your <acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym> folder.
    If properly extracted, you should have an iu_iwd folder, setup-iu_iwd, and
    setup-iu_iwd.command in your <acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym> folder.
    To install, simply double-click <strong>setup-iu_iwd.command</strong> and
    follow the instructions on screen.</p>
  <p><strong>Linux</strong><br />
  Download the latest version of <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> for Linux from <a href="http://www.weidu.org/%7Ethebigg">weidu.org</a> and extract (at least)  		the WeiDU, weinstall and tolower executables in a $PATH directory (E.G.  		/usr/bin). </p>
  <p> Following that, open a terminal, cd to your <acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym> or <acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym>-in-<acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> installation directory,  	run `tolower' and answer Y to both queries (*). </p>
  <p> After that, run 'weinstall iu_iwd from your <acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym> or <acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym>-in-<acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> installation directory to install or uninstall the mod. </p>
  <p> *:  		You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if   you've already ran it  		once in the same directory. To save time, the   archive is already tolowered,  	so there's no need to run the first   option (lowercasing file names) either  		if you've extracted only this   mod since the last time you lower cased file  		name. If you're unsure,   running tolower and choosing both options is the safe  		bet. </p>

<h2>Contents</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>The idea for the mod came about during my latest Icewind Dale game. Reading
    through the item descriptions, the developers really took a lot of time to
    give many items an elaborate backstory. In many cases, I felt that an upgrade
    was a chance to tell a bit more of the story.</p>
  <p>There were two main drawbacks to an Item Upgrade mod for IWD--first, you
    can't rely on some items being in the game, as many are part of random
    treasure lists. At least two items available for upgrades may not appear
    in any given game. The other issue is that, unlike Cromwell in BG2, there's
    no 'magic dwarf' available early to facilitate upgrades. This means that
    the upgrades are accomplished through a variety of means, which was good
    in the long run as it provides more of a role-playing flavor to the mod.</p>
  <p>Six items were also added from Baldur's Gate II, as they seemed appropriate
    for where they were placed in the game.</p>
  <p>Vexed Armor can be made safe if the party learns the true name of the demon after acquiring the armor. </p>
  <p>I'd like to think the upgrades are straightforward enough that players can
    discover them with a little thought, so further details are available in
    the form of spoilers:</p>

<h2> Distribution Note </h2>
<div class="section">
  <p> The modding community for the Infinity Engine has been going strong for more than a decade and is the culmination of thousands of unpaid modding
    hours by fellow fans of the game. Modders produce their best work, and players
    get the best, well-supported mods, when we all work together. </p>
  <p> There are two big ways to upset this harmony. One is to claim someone else's
    work as your own. The second is to host and redistribute a mod without permission
    from the author(s). </p>
  <p> Be kind to your fellow players and modders. Don't do either. </p>

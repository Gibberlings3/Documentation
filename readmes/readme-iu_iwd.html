      <p>One of the many fantastic things about Icewind Dale was the time the writers
        took in their item descriptions. This mod started by reading various item
        descriptions and trying to tell more of their story.</p>
      <p>The scope of the mod is fairly modest, as only 11 items are eligible for
        upgrade. Six items, based on Baldur's Gate II, are also available. </p>

      <p>The components work with or without the expansions Heart of Winter and Trials
        of the Luremaster. This mod makes interactive changes and therefore should
        be compatible with other mods, and at present there are no known incompatibilities. While the Icewind Dale Tweak Pack is generally
        recommended to be installed last, this mod will detect and apply appropriate
        changes if it is installed after Tweaks. </p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/topic/24870-iwd-mod-install-order-thread/">good rundown of install order and incompatibilities</a> for several common Icewind Dale mods is available on the forums. </p>
      <p>This mod also works on the <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/forum/155-icewind-dale-in-baldurs-gate-ii/">Icewind Dale in Baldurs Gate II</a> project, though the project itself has been discontinued.</p>
      <p>This mod is not needed on the Enhanced Edition of Icewind Dale, as it is built into the game itself. </p>

      <p><strong>Windows</strong><br />
        Item Upgrade for Icewind Dale  for Windows is   distributed as a     self-extracting   archive and includes a WeiDU   installer. To install,     simply double-click   the archive and follow   the instructions on   screen.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, the files can be extracted into your game directory using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a> or <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-iu_iwd.exe</strong> and the folder <strong>iu_iwd</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-iu_iwd.exe</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-iu_iwd.exe</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>macOS</strong><br />
        Item Upgrade for Icewind Dale for macOS is   distributed as a compressed tarball and includes a WeiDU installer.</p>
      <p>First, extract the files from the tarball into your game directory. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-iu_iwd</strong>, <strong>setup-iu_iwd.command</strong>, and the folder <strong>iu_iwd</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-iu_iwd.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-iu_iwd.command</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>Linux</strong><br />
        Item Upgrade for Icewind Dale for Linux is   distributed as a   compressed   tarball and does not   include a WeiDU   installer.  Linux   users will need   to do a one-time   install of <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility"><abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr></abbr> (and a few other adjustments) as described in <a href="https://moebiusproject.gitlab.io/mods_on_linux" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">this great writeup</a>. </p>
      <p>To install, run 'WeInstall iu_iwd in your game folder. </p>
      <p><strong> Note for Complete Uninstallation</strong><br />
        In addition to the methods above for removing individual       components, you can completely uninstall the mod using       setup-iu_iwd --uninstall at the command line to remove all       components without wading through prompts. </p>

      <p>The idea for the mod came about during my latest Icewind Dale game. Reading
        through the item descriptions, the developers really took a lot of time to
        give many items an elaborate backstory. In many cases, I felt that an upgrade
        was a chance to tell a bit more of the story.</p>
      <p>There were two main drawbacks to an Item Upgrade mod for IWD&mdash;first, you
        can't rely on some items being in the game, as many are part of random
        treasure lists. At least two items available for upgrades may not appear
        in any given game. The other issue is that, unlike Cromwell in BG2, there's
        no 'magic dwarf' available early to facilitate upgrades. This means that
        the upgrades are accomplished through a variety of means, which was good
        in the long run as it provides more of a role-playing flavor to the mod.</p>
      <p>Six items were also added from Baldur's Gate II, as they seemed appropriate
        for where they were placed in the game.</p>
      <p>Vexed Armor can be made safe if the party learns the true name of the demon after acquiring the armor. </p>
      <p>I'd like to think the upgrades are straightforward enough that players can
        discover them with a little thought, so further details are available in
        the form of spoilers:</p>

      <p>The modding community for the Infinity Engine has been going   strong since 1998, and is the culmination of thousands of unpaid modding          hours by fellow fans of the game. Modders produce their best   work and players          get the best, well-supported mods when we all work together. </p>
      <p> There are two big ways to upset this harmony. One is to claim someone else's          work as your own. The second is to host and redistribute a mod without permission          from the author(s). </p>

    <div class="section">
      <p><strong>Version 7 - January 30, 2025</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed an exploit where the player could get multiple Belts of Gond from Oswald (thanks ZFR)</li>
        <li>Orrick is only supposed each of his items once, but you could get around this in a few cases (again thanks to ZFR)</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version 6 - December 1, 2021</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Quiver of Plenty +1 was providing +1 arrows, but they were using the projectile of normal arrows, meaning they would get blocked by Protection From Normal Missiles</li>
        <li>The Remorrhaz 
          Shell Helm had some extraneous resistance effects which have been removed</li>
        <li>Upgrades which use Contact Other Plane have been updated to allow questions in the TotLM portion of the game to keep in step with IWD Fixpack v7</li>

        <li>Previous versions disabled effects by changing their probabilities (e.g. removing the berserk chance from the upgraded Young Rage). However, this was done in such a way that it still left a 1% chance for these effects to occur; these removed effects are now deleted outright. </li>
        <li>Removed a lot of leftover compatibility code with the deprecated G3 Dale Tweaks mod</li>
        <li>General code improvements and modernization</li>
        <li>Added Project Infinity compatibility</li>

        <li>Removed conversable flag for the Gnomish Tools in IWD-in-BG2 games</li>
        <li>Patch to make Mystery of the Dead protect against the divine version of Finger of Death now only applies to IWD-in-BG2 games</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version 3 - January 16, 2010</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Updated installer to <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> 226 </li>
        <li>Fixed bugs with Orrick creating the Winter Wolf Cloack and Yeti Hide Armor.
          <ul>
            <li>Closed dialogue option that allowed you to request multiple Yeti Hide Armor or Winter Wolf Cloaks</li>
            <li>If both items were ready at the same time, the party mistakenly received two Yeti Hide Armors instead of one of each</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Yeti Hide Armor no longer disabled thieving skills</li>
        <li>Bag of Plenty was seriously bugged and is now fixed. </li>

      <ul>
        <li>Updated installer to <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> 213 </li>

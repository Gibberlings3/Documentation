  <p><strong><a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/">A Gibberlings
        Three Mod</a><br />
    Author: Eric Kerr (aka Cirerrek)</strong></p>

  <p><strong> Version 1.3 - <a href="http://gibberlings3.net/forums/index.php?app=downloads&amp;showcat=25">Check
        for the most recent version</a></strong></p>
</div>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>seqmem.bs is a little script written by cirerrek to enable
    a player to remember what they have stored in their minor
    spell sequencers, spell sequencers, and spell triggers, after
  a couple of days away from the game.</p>
  <p>The basic mechanics for this script were originally developed
    by Bruce Harding.</p>
  <p>Sequencer Memory  is really intended to be a plugin for existing Player <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> scripts
    and you are welcome to add it to your own. The downloadable
    version of this script includes the commented .baf for your
    convenience.</p>


  <p>The variables set by this script can easily be used to allow
    Player <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> scripts
    to cast sequencers automatically. I don't plan on going into
    any details about this here, but if you are interested in
    this feature and are having trouble figuring out how to implement
    it, please contact me at cirerrek@hotmail.com</p>

  <p>The script will NOT report the exact spells you have stored
    in your sequencers but it will give you a general idea of
    how you originally chose to target the sequencer(s). The
    three targeting strategies available are: Offensive, Disabling,
    and Defensive.</p>
  <p>You select a targeting strategy through the use of hotkeys.
    The choice of keys may seem a bit odd, but they are some
    of the few hotkeys that were not used by the <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/cirerrek/eseries.php">eSeries</a> player <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> scripts
    developed by Sarkyn and modified/continued/updated by me
    (cirerrek). </p>
</div>
<h2>Compatibility</h2>

<h2>Contents</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p><strong>How to select the script:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>  Select a spellcaster in your party by left clicking
      on them</li>
    <li> Press R on the keyboard, which will take you to the
      selected characters record sheet</li>
    <li> Left Click on Customize (located towards the bottom
      of the record sheet)</li>
    <li> Left Click on Script</li>
    <li> Scroll through the avaible Party <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> Scripts until
      you come to SEQUENCER-MEMORY</li>
    <li> Left click on it to select this script</li>
    <li> Click Done</li>
    <li> Click Done Again</li>
    <li> You should now be back to the record sheet. Press
      G on the keyboard to return to the game world. </li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>How to utilize the script:</strong></p>
  <p> Press V on the keyboard This will display the current status
    of your sequencers (Locked or Inactive)</p>
  <ul>
    <li>  Locked - Into a particular strategy (Offensive, Disabling,
      or Defensive)</li>
    <li> Inactive - You do not have a sequencer active</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Inactive will be returned for one of two reasons:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> You do not have a sequencer active, meaning you have
      not memorized and cast any of the three types of sequencers.</li>
    <li> You started a save game in which you already have
      a sequencer active and did not use SEQUENCER-MEMORY to
      'record' a targeting strategy when you originally activated
      the sequencer. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Locked+Targeting Strategy will be returned if you have used
    SEQUENCER-MEMORY to 'record' a targeting strategy for one
    or more of the three types of sequencers.</p>
  <p><strong>How to lock a targeting strategy (Example):</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>  Have one of your wizards of the appropriate level
      memorize the spell Minor Spell Sequencer</li>
    <li> Make sure your wizard also has two first level offensive
      spells such as Magic Missile or Chromatic Orb memorized.</li>
    <li> Rest </li>
    <li> Cast Minor Spell Sequencer</li>
    <li> Select two first level offensive spells to place
      in the Minor Spell Sequencer</li>
    <li> Left Click Done</li>
    <li> A few seconds later, the message text &quot;Toggle the
      N key to select a targeting strategy followed by the F key
      to confirm the strategy.&quot; will float over the character's
      head and also be displayed in the text box at the bottom
      of the game screen.</li>
    <li> Press the N key 1, 2, or 3 times depending on the
      targeting strategy you would like to select.
      <ul>
    <li> N Key Once - Offensive</li>
    <li> N Key Twice - Disabling</li>
    <li> N Key Thrice - Defensive </li>
      </ul>
     A message will float over your head each time you press
      the N Key. The contents of the message will change depending
      on what type of sequencer you have cast and are trying
      to target. This message will also be displayed in the text
      box, along with the text &quot;To change, toggle N; to
      confirm, press F&quot;</li>
    <li> Since for this example we have chosen to memorize
      two first level offensive spells we will want to press
      F to lock in the targeting strategy after pressing N only
      once.</li>
    <li> Once F has been pressed, a message will be displayed
      over the character's head and in the text box. The contents
      of the message will change depending on what type of sequencer
      you have cast and are trying to lock, but whichever sequencer
      it is, you will see &quot;-Locked&quot; at the end of the
      message.</li>
    <li> Congratulations, you have successfully locked in
      the targeting strategy for the sequencer!</li>
    <li> Press V and the following messages will be displayed
      in the text box: Minor Spell Sequencer Locked - Offensive
      Spell Sequencer - Inactive Spell Trigger - Inactive</li>
    <li>  Three days later when you come back to your saved
      game and you don't remember what you have stored in Minor
      Spell Sequencer, press V. You will be reminded that offensive
      spells are stored, and you will know not to use your sequencer
      on yourself or another party member ;) </li>
  </ol>
  <p>This method works the same way for all three types of sequencers:
    Minor Spell Sequencer, Spell Sequencer, and Spell Trigger.
    Only the floating and text box messages will change to reflect
    which type of sequencer you are trying to target.</p>
  <p><strong>Known Issues:</strong></p>
  <p>The game mechanics do not allow for two sequencers of the
    same type to be active on any one character at at time. This
    means that if you already have a Spell Trigger active and
    try to cast another, you will be greeted by a message &quot;You
    can not cast multiple instances of the same contigency spell
    on yourself&quot;. This message is not caused by this script.</p>
  <p>This feature is important to this script because if you
    do cast any of the three types of sequencers while you already
    have one of that type active, the script will be activated
    and you will prompted to re-target that sequencer. If you
    do not target the sequencer exactly the same way you initially
    targeted the sequencer using SEQUENCER-MEMORY, the sequencer
    in question will then have an incorrect targeting definition
    assigned to it. </p>

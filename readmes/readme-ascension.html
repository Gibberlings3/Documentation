                    Ascension is a collection of changes to Throne of Bhaal, aimed at providing a richer story and more
                    tactically interesting gameplay. Its largest component completely rewrites the finale (chapter 10)
                    of Throne of Bhaal, adding new enemies and new allies; other components enhance the tactical
                    challenge of many of the key battles in Throne of Bhaal, improve plot-central dialogues and player
                    abilities, and more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ascension dates back to the dawn of Baldur's Gate modding: the designers were Cuveronious, Quitch,
                    Xyx, Spork, Vulgar Zildrah, and Kensai Ryu, and the project team leader was David Gaider, one of the
                    writers on Throne of Bhaal itself (and later lead writer for the Dragon Age series). It has gone
                    through many updates and many maintainers since then - Westley Weimer (original author of WeiDU);
                    and Miloch; White Agnus and JediMindTrix; AL|EN, and more - with contributions from many other
                    modders.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This version is coded by DavidW (author of Sword Coast Stratagems and Wheels of Prophecy). It is a
                    fairly systematic, ground-up rewrite of Ascension using modern coding techniques and taking
                    advantage of Enhanced Edition functionality (while remaining backward-compatible with non-enhanced
                    versions of Throne of Bhaal). In the rewrite, the component structure of Ascension was modified,
                    breaking the main component into several sub-components (this was not possible in the original
                    Ascension because of the very limited modding methods of the time), a very large number of small
                    bugs were fixed, and some minor changes in implementation were made, reflecting modern coding
                    methods and resources. I have tried to remain extremely faithful to the original Ascension. (Still,
                    purists might want to look at the <a href="#customisation">customisation</a> section for how to get
                    a completely faithful experience.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is probably redundant eighteen years after Ascension's release, but I have hidden the name of
                    the final villain of Throne of Bhaal through the main part of this readme; I refer to her by her
                    first initial, A.

                    Ascension is compatible with both the original and Enhanced-Edition versions of Throne of Bhaal, as
                    well as the Baldur's Gate Trilogy and Enhanced Edition Trilogy. On non-Enhanced versions of the
                    game, it requires the BG2 fixpack, available at
                    <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/mods/fixes/bg2fixpack/">Gibberlings Three</a>, to be installed
                    first.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ascension is probably best installed fairly early in a multi-mod installation order. (Because Ascension
                    has been an iconic mod right through the modding era, many mods are likely to be aware of it and respond
                    to it, but that requires Ascension to be installed first.) However, version 2.0 is much more compatibility-
                    friendly than earlier versions, so it is less crucial to install it first.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These specific mods should be installed <b>before</b> Ascension 2.0:

                        <li>Edwin Romance (version 2.0.7) - Ascension has code specifically to allow for this mod
                        </li>
                        <li>Iylos (version 2.6) - Ascension has code specifically to allow for this mod
                        </li>
                        <li>The BG2 Fixpack - as noted above, Ascension actually requires this mod on a non-Enhanced
                            install.
                        </li>

                    These specific mods should be installed <b>after</b> Ascension 2.0:

                    Ascension is distributed as a self-extracting archive and includes a WeiDU installer. To install,
                    simply double-click the archive and follow the instructions on screen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alternatively, the files can be extracted into your game directory using
                    <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a> or <a
                        href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>.
                    When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-ascension.exe</strong> and
                    the folder
                    <strong>ascension</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-ascension.exe</strong> and follow
                    the instructions on screen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can run <strong>setup-ascension.exe</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or
                    otherwise change components.</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>macOS</strong><br />
                    Ascension for macOS is distributed as a compressed tarball and includes a WeiDU installer.</p>
                <p>
                    First, extract the files from the tarball into your game directory. When properly extracted, your
                    game directory will contain <strong>setup-ascension</strong>,
                    <strong>setup-ascension.command</strong>, and the folder <strong>ascension</strong>. To install,
                    double-click <strong>setup-ascension.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
                <p>
                    You can run <strong>setup-ascension.command</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or
                    otherwise change components.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Linux</strong><br />
                    Ascension for Linux is distributed as a compressed tarball and does not include a WeiDU installer.
                </p>
                <p>Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.</p>
                <p>
                    Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a
                        href="http://www.weidu.org/%7Ethebigg/">WeiDU.org</a> and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin.
                    Following that, open a terminal, cd to your game installation directory, run tolower and answer Y to
                    both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in
                    the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the
                    first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only this mod since the last time
                    you lowercased file names. If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe
                    bet.
                </p>
                <p>To install, run WeInstall ascension in your game folder. Then run wine BGMain.exe and start playing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Note for Complete Uninstallation</strong><br />
                    In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely uninstall
                    the mod using setup-ascension --uninstall at the command line to remove all components without
                    wading through prompts.

                        Some people like the ending to Throne of Bhaal well enough, I guess. I liked it well enough (I
                        did a lot of the work on it, after all), but I remember wishing that we had had the time to
                        tinker with it more. At Bioware we never seemed to have enough time to tinker with the Infinity
                        Engine scripting language as much as I might have liked. With better AI and some leisurely time
                        spent considering various options, the ending might have been more fully realized. That's a game
                        designer's fantasy, obviously, especially when you're working within the time-frame of an
                        expansion (which must come out while the game's still on peoples' HARD-drives)...but seeing as a
                        mod like this can be done in one's spare time, it doesn't have to be. Consider this my offering
                        of what might have been. You might not necessarily like it better...heck, you might not even
                        like it at all...but I think it shows off what the Infinity Engine can do when stretched to its
                        limit and offers a bit more bite to Throne of Bhaal's climax for those who think that's not a
                        bad idea.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The whole thing started on Black Isle's BG2 message boards. A friend of mine, Kevin Dorner ...
                        had expressed a bit of disappointment at the fact that he had had no choice but to fight the
                        strongest member of the Five, Balthazar. Balthazar was a Lawful Good monk, after all, and
                        wouldn't a charismatic and heroic Lawful Good character be able to maybe talk some sense into
                        him? He suggested that it would have been better to offer a non-fighting alternative or, hey,
                        how about getting Balthazar to fight with you in the final battle?</p>
                    <p>
                        Another poster (alas, I forget who exactly) offered another idea that it would have been a great
                        idea if the Five had been resurrected in the final battle...that it would be cool to face them
                        all at once. And I agreed...that was a very interesting idea.</p>
                    <p>
                        So the Ascension was born. At first it was just a bit of extra dialogue for Balthazar and some
                        work on the final battle, itself...but it's turned into a lot more than was expected.</p>

                    These components collectively make up the original 'Ascension' mod. They all relate to the core

                                        completely redone, from start to finish. Gone are the Elemental Princes and the
                                        multiple battles with A. and her Slayer Shadows. A. has been completely re-done,
                                        and the allies she brings to bear against you make this a whole new fight. ...

                                        better AI: a lot of work has gone into the AI of the opponents you'll face. You
                                        can often disrupt their spells, but they'll work at preventing you from being
                                        able to. They are still immune to stuff that's appropriate, but the stuff they
                                        aren't immune to they will try and deal with when you use it on them. They'll
                                        target appropriate opponents with the appropriate attacks and generally use
                                        their abilities wisely. A. is still a power-house...but she's practically a
                                        demigod...the fight against her this time is much more tactical and you've got
                                        to figure out how to weaken her before you can take her down.</p>

                        This component entirely replaces Chapter 10 of Throne of Bhaal, substantially affecting both the
                        story and the tactical gameplay. A detailed walkthrough, with spoilers, is <a
                            href="ascension-additional.html#ascension_details">here</a>, so I'll say little about the
                        contents beyond Gaider's comments above. But anyone new to Ascension should know two things.
                        Firstly, it is highly responsive to the difficulty slider (even more so in this version than in
                        previous versions). And secondly, it is much more difficult than the baseline game. If you are
                        used to playing Baldur's Gate on Core difficulty and without difficulty mods, I recommend trying
                        Ascension on the Easy, or at most the Normal, difficulty setting. 'Core' difficulty is probably
                        about equivalent to the lower end of the Sword Coast Stratagems mod. For veterans of Ascension,
                        'Hard' fairly accurately reproduces the 'Core" experience of previous versions of Ascension;
                        'Core' is slightly easier than previously.</p>
                    <p>
                        In the original Readme, Gaider laments that he can't disable the automatic increased/decreased
                        damage on different difficulty settings; modern tools allow this on either the Enhanced Edition
                        or on Windows versions of original Throne of Bhaal, and this version of Ascension implements
                        Gaider's wishes. See under <a href="#customisation">customisation</a> for how to disable this
                        (though in the Enhanced Edition, you can just do so on the Gameplay page).

                            Balthazar has a lot more to discuss with you when you meet him in his stronghold. He's a
                            Lawful Good monk determined to destroy Bhaal and his evil essence forever, even in
                            himself...but, depending on your own nature, you may be able to talk him into forgoing a
                            battle or even fighting A. at your side. This is, however, not an easy thing to do.

                        This implementation of Balthazar separates the possibility of redeeming him as an ally both from
                        the general rewrite of Chapter 10 and from the 'tougher Balthazar' tactical improvement (now a
                        separate component). This means in particular that you can get Balthazar's help against A. even
                        if you decide to go for the non-Ascension version of chapter 10. (This is code by DavidW,
                        adapted from the Wheels of Prophecy mod.) If you want some hints on how Balthazar can be
                        redeemed, see <a href="ascension-additional.html#redeeming_balthazar">here.</a></p>
                    <p>
                        Version 2.0 also makes Balthazar's powers fully usable by the player (this required some minor
                        tweaks in the powers themselves, and some icons borrowed, with thanks, from the ones CamDawg
                        designed for Kish's Oversight mod). For full details of Balthazar's powers, see

                            Imoen and Sarevok have some dialogues with the PC in ToB that are fairly important. For
                            Imoen, it involves her growing taint and she gets some Bhaalspawn abilities. For Sarevok, it
                            involves the chance of him changing alignment. In ToB these were completely random...but
                            since their stories come up in the Ascension, I thought it was important that these be seen.

                        of being random. Sarevok will have these discussions with the player (unless they happen to come

                            The Slayer form that the player picks up in Spellhold all the way back in BG2 now upgrades.

                            considerably stronger and deadlier, and one big change you will notice is that occasionally
                            you will lose control over yourself. The Slayer can sometimes go berserk and will attack the

                            be a respite in the very last round before you take too much damage. The last upgrade gives

                    A note about this version: the modding tools available when this component was originally written
                    made it extremely difficult to add new names for creatures, so the drakes added use rather strange
                    names re-used from minor peasants and shopkeepers in the original Baldur's Gate (and are not
                    identified in game as drakes at all). I (DavidW) took the opportunity to give them more evocative
                    and meaningful names: Earth Drake, Fire Drake, Ice Drake, Shadow Drake. (If you prefer the
                    originals, you can disable this; see under <a href="#customisation">customisation</a>.) Technically
                    this is also true for the purple dragon, 'Tamah': she is named for an incredibly minor character in
                    BG1. But Tamah has rather better name recognition, so I've left this alone.

                    saves to use in dragon form), rather than the very rudimentary script in the original 'tougher
                    enemies', and to use the magical/electrical damage sword he wields in that battle. Again, see under

                    This component enhances Balthazar and his monks when you encounter them late in Chapter 9, and
                    improves their AI. It is extracted from the original 'Ascension' component (it is not the original,
                    ancient 'tougher Balthazar' which Gaider wrote before Ascension).

                    This implementation of 'Tougher Demogorgon' makes some cosmetic improvements to Demogorgon's Gate
                    spells (the gate animation plays properly before the demons appear, rather than being overlaid on
                    already-summoned demons) and also implements a change made around v1.5 of Ascension, where the
                    'Summon the Infernal Host' spell is renamed to 'Summon the Abyssal Host' for lore reasons. (As usual
                    you can disable both: see under <a href="#customisation">customisation</a>.)

                    This version of 'Tougher Gromnir' reads back to the original Gromnir the standard suite of
                    protections that Throne of Bhaal's Bhaalspawn get in Ascension. It also provides new names for two
                    added creatures: as with the 'Tougher Abazigal' component, additional creatures have re-used names,
                    in this case taken from a Beregost shopkeeper and from one of Sendai's allies. I rename them
                    'Minotaur Battle-Priest' and 'Il-Khan Medusa'. As usual, see under <a

                        a credible opponent and member of the Five. She's a ranger/archer now,
                        which was her original concept before we were forced to make the battle
                        much, much easier (since people could potentially meet her with a single,
                        newly-created sorcerer...and since the fight was unavoidable, those who
                        couldn't get past it would be quite frustrated).

                        Despite what Gaider is saying, the Tougher Illasera
                        battle is widely regarded as insanely difficult (although certain tactics,
                        like the shield of reflection, physical mirror or a mordy jail can make it
                        too simple). It's much HARDer than the Yaga-Shura or Gromnir fights.

                    Although I (DavidW) haven't tested it on the original game, at least in Enhanced-Edition BG2 an
                    engine glitch means that Illasera's powerful magical arrows deliver their payload twice per hit,
                    which would certainly enhance the difficulty! This is fixed in this version. (It's obviously a bug,
                    so I haven't offered a way to disable it.)

                        into the mix). Yaga-Shura himself has been given some better powers and
                        AI, including his lieutenants...and his invulnerability slowly wears off
                        during the course of the battle with him, making this fight a bit trickier.

                    clerics in line with the way all other army members are named, i.e. just as 'Yaga-Shura Cleric'. (As
                    with other components, original Ascension could not introduce new strings, and so had to re-use an

                    This component (whose author I don't know) uses the full-body illustration of Bodhi (used in the
                    game's promotional material, and used by Ascension for Bodhi's epilogue) as her in-game
                    illustration, used in her dialogue. You can see the portrait

                        target="_blank">here</a>. The artist is Lorne Ledger, aka 'Cuv' or 'Cuveronius', who worked on
                    the original Ascension and wrote Balthazar's epilogue (and who also coded parts of the first

                    player who ascends; the other applies if Dorn loses his blackguard status). You can get a preview of
                    the new epilogues by using a text editor to open ascension/lang/english/shawnesepilogues_eenpc.tra.

                <p><strong>Sharpened portraits of Abazigal and Gromnir, by DavidW (Enhanced Edition only)</strong></p>
                <p>
                    The portraits for most NPCs in BG2 are upscaled in the Enhanced Edition, but for some reason
                    Abazigal, Balthazar and Gromnir were omitted. The engine automatically scales the portraits, but
                    they end up quite blurry as a result. In the case of Balthazar, Ascension automatically supplies a
                    sharp, higher-resolution image; this component makes some attempt to do the same for Abazigal and
                    Gromnir, using Photoshop's sharpening algorithm. You can see the effect if you compare
                    <a href="../ascport/dwsharpen/grom_old.png" target="_blank">old</a> and
                    <a href="../ascport/dwsharpen/grom_new.png" target="_blank">new</a> versions of Gromnir - it's not

                <p>
                    This minor component slightly tightens the implementation of the cutscenes just before encountering
                    Yaga-Shura and Gromnir. In the former, the soldiers you run into don't sometimes randomly give the
                    same line three times. In the latter, the party arrive in Gromnir's throne room just after Melissan
                    is taken away, rather than standing around passively and watching while this happens.

                    As of version 2.0, Ascension permits a significant amount of "fine tuning" over and above your
                    install

                    a

                <strong>Regeneration</strong>
                <p>
                    There was a systematic bug in all pre-2.0 versions of Ascension, which meant that the (many)
                    creatures who were given the ability to regenerate did not actually receive it. Originally I
                    intended just to fix this - but some of the rates are quite fast, and I'm worried about unbalancing
                    the game (after all, Ascension's playtesting was with the bug present). I toyed with setting it up
                    so that regeneration only happened at or above a certain difficulty: 'HARD', by default. But in the
                    end I decided to deactivate it. These settings let you reactivate it, and tweak it.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>skip_regeneration_fix(1) - set to 0 to enable the fixes to regeneration.</li>
                    <li>regeneration_difficulty_minimum(4) - this determines the minimum difficulty setting when
                        regeneration occurs, on a scale where 1=Easy, 2=Normal, 3=Core, 4=Hard, 5=Insane. (Of course,
                        this is moot unless regeneration is enabled.)</li>
                    <li>yaga_shura_regenerates(0) - Yaga-Shura has a regeneration rate of 7 hit points per second, and
                        in combination with his very high resistances I worry this will be especially unbalanced; so by
                        default, it's disabled. Set this to 1 to enable it.</li>
                </ul>
                <strong>Demons</strong>
                <p>These variables control tweaks I made to a few of the demons in Chapter 10. (For more details, see
                    the comments in the file 'ascension_demons.tpa', in ascension/ascensionmain.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>restore_original_babau_weapon(0) - Babaus have a weapon clearly inspired (as with most of
                        Ascension's demons) by second edition D&D's demons: in that source material, Babaus are covered
                        in slime which causes weapons to corrode. But the implementation is weird, and uses the
                        unpopular 'drop weapons in panic' opcode. I replace it with a thematically similar effect - a
                        5-round, -2 to melee damage, -2 to melee attack, penalty, with a 20% chance of being applied
                        with each hit, no save. Set this to 1 to restore the original weapon.</li>
                    <li>restore_original_glabrezu_weapon(0) - Similarly, Glabrezu have a D&D-inspired grab ability,
                        which has some odd implementation glitches. I redo this, fairly minimally - but set this
                        variable to 1 if you want the original weapon.</li>
                </ul>
                <strong>Slayer form</strong>
                <p>These make tweaks to the player's Slayer form, including the upgraded versions introduced by
                    Ascension.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>slayer_enhancement_threshold_1 (2000000) - this is the XP required to gain the first slayer
                        upgrade. I don't actually change this (2,000,000 is Gaider's original choice), it's just
                        externalised for players who want to customise it.</li>
                    <li>slayer_enhancement_threshold_2 (4000000) - the XP threshold required to gain the second slayer
                        upgrade.</li>
                    <li>slayer_enhancement_threshold_3 (6000000) - the XP threshold required to gain the final slayer
                        upgrade.</li>
                    <li>slayer_reputation_penalty_1 (1) - the Reputation penalty incurred each time you use the Slayer.
                        This is actually unchanged from the original version in Ascension; again, it's just externalised
                        for players' convenience. (Note that in-game documentation is not adjusted if you change this
                        value.)</li>
                    <li>slayer_reputation_penalty_2 (1) - the Reputation penalty incurred when you use the upgraded form
                        of the Slayer you get at 2 million XP.</li>
                    <li>slayer_reputation_penalty_3 (2) - the Reputation penalty incurred when you use the
                        still-further-upgraded form of the Slayer you get at 4 million XP.</li>
                    <li>slayer_reputation_penalty_4 (3) - the Reputation penalty incurred when you change into the
                        Ravager.</li>
                    <li>slayer_2_regeneration (2) - the per-second regeneration rate of the upgraded Slayer form. This
                        is a v2.0 tweak (part of a slight rebalancing / systematising of the Slayer form, and based on
                        Imoen's slayer form); the original Ascension value for this and other regeneration rates is
                        zero. Tweaks to this value (and the two that follow) are reflected in in-game documentation on
                        the Enhanced Edition.</li>
                    <li>slayer_3_regeneration (3) - the per-second regeneration rate of the second upgraded Slayer form.
                        (Again, the original Ascension value is zero.)</li>
                    <li>ravager_regeneration (5) - the per-second regeneration rate of the Ravager form. (The original
                        Ascension value is zero; this matches the actual Ravager.)</li>
                    <li>slayer_mr_reduction (10) - the Magic Resistance reduction caused by the slayer's hits when a
                        Dispel Magic is triggered (which happens 10% of the time for the second upgraded Slayer form).
                        This is a slight tweak on the original Ascension value, which is 5%.</li>
                    <li>ravager_knockback (0) - the Ravager form in original Ascension has an automatic knockback on a
                        small fraction of hits. My experience of knockbacks is that they are bug-prone (creatures get
                        knocked into inaccessible areas) and so are probably best avoided, given that the Ravager power
                        can be used anywhere and might not be under the player's control. But you can set this value to
                        1 to re-enable it.</li>
                    <li>additive_slayer_hitpoints(1) - Ascension documentation is a bit unclear as to whether the slayer
                        form is supposed to get a fixed *number* of hit points, or a fixed *bonus* to hit points. To be
                        honest it's probably the former, but as a matter of balance the latter works better (the slayer
                        form can actually be a hit point downgrade for fighters). By default, Ascension makes it
                        additive; set this to zero to make it a fixed hit point level.</li>
                </ul>
                <strong>Player powers</strong>

                <p>These affect the various powers acquired by the player (except the Slayer form).</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>no_restored_bg1_powers (1) - set this to 1 if you don't want the original Bhaalspawn powers
                        (taken from you in Spellhold) to be regained at the start of Throne of Bhaal (or have already
                        installed/plan to install a component of another mod that does it).</li>
                    <li>demon_control_battle_duration (3) - this determines the length, in seconds, of the mental battle
                        that the player fights with demons in the final chapter. In original Ascension it's 6 seconds,
                        with a 50% chance of success, but removing the player from play for a full round in exchange for
                        a 50% chance of controlling a demon seems underpowered (and much weaker than Melissan's
                        comparable ability). So I've tweaked the default values to make it a bit more effective,
                        matching Melissan's.</li>
                    <li>demon_control_success_probability (75) - this is the percentage probability of the player's
                        demon control power works. (The original Ascension default, as noted above, is 50%.) </li>
                    <li>unleash_dice_number (20) - this is the number of d12 rolled to determine the damage of the
                        player's 'unleash' power, with a save for half. In original Ascension it's 10d12, but I think
                        that's underpowered for this ability (especially given its disadvantages) so I've tweaked it up
                        by default.</li>
                    <li>replace_duhm (1) - one of the good-aligned Bhaalspawn powers is 'Draw Upon Holy Might',
                        repeating one of the original BG1 powers. This seems a bit unexciting (all the other powers are
                        new) so I replace it with a thematically-similar, slightly-more-powerful ability, 'Divine Gift'
                        (see <a href="ascension-additional.html#bhaalspawn_powers"> here</a> for the details). Set this
                        to 0 to restore the original Draw Upon Holy Might.</li>
                    <li>dimdoor_classic(0) - the teleport power that the player is granted in chapter 10 is, by default,
                        the standard Dimension Door power. Version 2.0 of Ascension tweaks it to something a bit more
                        visually new; but set this to 1 to restore the original.</li>
                </ul>
                <strong>The Five</strong>
                <p>These affect the Five Bhaalspawn and their minions.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>gromnir_immunities (1): by default, Gromnir gets the same suite of immunities that all
                        Bhaalspawn get. This wasn't the case in original Ascension; I think this was probably an
                        oversight or error, but in any case set this to 0 to restore original behavior.</li>
                    <li>gromnir_ally_renames (1): if this is 1, then Gromnir's minotaur and medusa allies get new
                        names; if it is zero, they continue to use recycled names from elsewhere in BG and BG2.</li>
                    <li>abazigal_drake_renames (1): similarly, set this to 0 to get Abazigal's drakes to revert to
                        using names borrowed from elsewhere in BG and BG2, rather than new names of their own.</li>
                    <li>yagashura_cleric_rename (1): if this is 1, then the army clerics in Yaga-Shura's army are
                        named as 'Yaga-Shura Cleric', along the lines of the rest of his army. If it is zero, they
                        continue to use a recycled name from elsewhere in BG2 ('Cleric of Talos').</li>
                    <li>tougher_abazigal_uses_finale_script (1): set it to 0 if you want Abazigal (when originally
                        encountered) to use the original 'tougher enemies' version of his script, not the Final-Five
                        version.</li>
                    <li>tougher_abazigal_uses_sword (1): set it to 0 if you don't want Abazigal (when originally
                        encountered) to use the undroppable variant on his sword that he carries in the Final-Five
                        battle.</li>
                    <li>lava_bomb_tweak (1): v2.0 of Ascension tweaks Lava Bomb's knockback to be more in line with
                        similar effects elsewhere, so that it knocks its targets unconscious for 3 seconds if they
                        fail to save at -10, rather than for 18 seconds if they fail to save at -2. Set this to 0 to
                        revert to the classic behavior.</li>

                </ul>
                <strong>Miscellaneous settings</strong>
                <p>These change other features of the mod.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>no_ee_sarevok_sword_use_restriction (0): Sarevok gets to upgrade his Sword of Chaos; in
                        original Ascension, that upgrade comes with a penalty applied to anyone except Sarevok.
                        Since that penalty is too extreme for anyone in their right mind to tolerate it, I
                        assume this is simply a way of restricting the weapon to Sarevok, which can't be done
                        directly in original Baldur's Gate. Since it <em>can</em> be done on the Enhanced
                        Edition, I implement it directly on BG2EE and EET installs; set this to 1 to revert to
                        the original even in EE games.</li>
                    <li>abyssal_host (1): Set this to 0 to prevent Demogorgon's lore-inaccurate 'summon the
                        infernal host' power being rewritten as 'summon the abyssal host'.</li>
                    <li>demogorgon_gate_aesthetics (1): set this to 0 to revert my cosmetic changes to
                        Demogorgon's summoning power. (I've coded an override here because those cosmetic
                        changes do slightly delay the demons' arrival, so there is a (very minor) tactical
                        consequence.)</li>
                    <li>enable_difficulty_based_damage_changes (0): set this to 1 to revert Ascension 2.0's
                        default behavior (following Gaider's preference) of disabling the hardcoded damage
                        changes caused by the difficulty slider.</li>
                    <li>balthazar_hotkey(E): set this to whatever key you want to use to toggle Balthazar's AI
                        on and off.</li>
                    <li>ignore_sarevok_edge_case(0): it is possible for Sarevok to become good-aligned but not
                        be in the party when you confront Melissan. In this situation, in vanilla Ascension
                        Sarevok always opposes you. Perhaps this represents his backsliding towards evil if
                        you're not around, but I think it's much more likely just to be an edge case the
                        original writers didn't notice or didn't have time to sort. In any case, Ascension v2.0
                        allows a redeemed-but-not-in-party Sarevok to end up rejecting Melissan's blandishments
                        and joining you. Set this parameter to 1 if you want to revert to the original behavior.
                    </li>
                    <li>sarevok_hotkey(E): set this to whatever key you want to use to toggle Sarevok's AI on
                        and off, in case he joins you in the final fight in the edge-case scenario above.</li>
                </ul>
                <strong>Internal/Debug</strong>
                <p>Don't touch these: they're for testing and internal use.</p>

                <strong>DavidW's acknowledgements:</strong>
                <p>
                    First and foremost, thanks to David Gaider and his original team. Ascension has stood the test of
                    time as one of the all-time great mods; it's been a privilege to work on it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Secondly, huge thanks to those heroes - especially WhiteAgnus and JediMindTrix - who did the heavy
                    lifting required to drag Ascension into the modern-coding, Enhanced-Edition era. Ascension 2.0 is
                    built on the bones of their work and couldn't have existed without it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thirdly, thanks to those who created the tools that made the modern Infinity Engine modding scene
                    possible: in particular, Westley Weimer, for the original WeiDU; TheBigg and Wisp for developing it
                    into the remarkable tool it now is; CamDawg, for building many of the function libraries on which
                    Ascension is constructed and for leading the 'Fixpack' project which Ascension 2.0 relies on;
                    Ascension64, for finally realising David Gaider's goal of a more finely controllable difficulty
                    setting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The icons for Balthazar's abilities are borrowed from the Oversight mod; thanks to its creator,
                    Kish,
                    for permission, and to CamDawg for actually creating the icons (at least according to the readme; he
                    doesn't actually remember doing so :) ).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Last but not least, thanks to the original Bioware team for Throne of Bhaal, and to Beamdog - and
                    the
                    many modders and ex-modders who work with them - for reinventing the Infinity Engine.

                    <li>Slight refactoring of the dialogs to facilitate SCS difficulty system (no in-game effect, this
                        is just to remove problems caused by text substitution into OR() blocks)</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>First release as a WeiDU mod (indeed, as one of the first WeiDU mods)</li>

                <strong>Version 1.6</strong> (AL|EN, September 2016)
                <ul>
                    <li>In September 2016 Ascension moved to the BigWorldProject Github page (now renamed to InfinityMods).</li>
                    <li>The version numbering had broken down by this point; I'm using '1.6' to refer to Ascension once it's moved to
                        InfinityMods, but releases in this period just carried dates.</li>
                    <li>Updates were localised bugfixes and translations; many contributors.</li>
                </ul>
                <strong>Version 1.7</strong> (multiple authors, November 2018)
                <ul>
                    <li>In November 2018, Roxanne collected together various fixes into a new release, and reinstated a
                        versioning system, starting at 1.7.0</li>
                    <li>This version of Ascension was still an incremental development of 1.5, and remained hosted at the
                        BigWorldProject Github page (now renamed to InfinityMods).</li>

                </ul>
                <strong>Version 2.0</strong> (DavidW, June 2019)

                <p>This was quite a large project and I may well have missed some small changes, but these are the main
                    changes:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The main component of Ascension has been split into 8 subcomponents: rewritten chapter 10;
                        redeemable Balthazar; restored Bhaalspawn powers; improved Sarevok/player dialog; improved
                        Imoen/player dialog; improved Slayer transformation; extended epilogues; tougher Balthazar.
                        (Ascension is so old that when it shipped, it was necessary to bundle as much as possible
                        into one place because you could only add dialog lines once.)</li>
                    <li>The components have been reorganized into three groups to make the mod's structure more
                        transparent: the Ascension (the various bits of the main component, less Tougher Balthazar);
                        Tougher Enemies; Additional Content (added to Ascension well after its release).</li>
                    <li>Dozens of small (mostly cosmetic) bugs were fixed, and the logic of the final chapter has
                        been tightened to correct a few persistent reported bugs</li>
                    <li>Tightened up the cosmetic features of some cutscenes and abilities (the line between this
                        and bugfixes is a little blurry.)</li>
                    <li>The code for the pool powers fairly clearly allows that Imoen should be able to receive them
                        instead of the player, but for technical reasons that wasn't working; I've restored it.</li>
                    <li>Added additional code (though no additional dialog) to permit a redeemed Balthazar to help
                        you even if you're using the original (non-Ascension) version of the final chapter</li>
                    <li>If Balthazar is allied with you, you should get much finer control of him (the previous AI
                        is quite willful) and can use any of his powers from the innate bar</li>
                    <li>Lots of small changes to allow for better compatibility with the Enhanced Edition (e.g., the
                        save-for-half flag is implemented; new innate powers have in-game descriptions instead of
                        being described in journal entries)</li>
                    <li>David Gaider's original Readme laments the fact that the hardcoded bits of the difficulty
                        slider can't be disabled. Since they can be disabled in modern BG (either on the Enhanced
                        Edition or on ToBex) I've disabled them, and taken the opportunity to spread the difficulty
                        settings a bit more evenly. 'Insane' is still just as hard as ever, but on the lower
                        difficulty settings the mod's combats are slightly less brutal than previously. (This is all
                        documented in some detail.)</li>
                    <li>Slightly tweaked the implementation of certain abilities to make use of modern tools and
                        techniques (again, see the documentation.)</li>
                    <li>In the original Ascension there is a (pretty edge-case) scenario where Sarevok is redeemed
                        but then leaves the party only to be summoned by Melissan. I've allowed for this in
                        Sarevok's dialog: he gets the 'redeemed' dialog option even if he has left the party, and
                        can fight for you.</li>
                    <li>The original mod's documentation suggests that there is a route through Balthazar's
                        redemption for a high-wisdom Evil character. That wasn't actually the case in the
                        distributed version so far as I can tell (and I checked the logic pretty thoroughly); I have
                        tweaked the parameters of the conversation very slightly so that a narrow route now exists.
                    </li>
                    <li>Added a very small component of my own that fixes an anomaly on the cutscenes with
                        Yaga-Shura and Gromnir (it could have lived in SCS but it seemed a more natural fit to
                        Ascension).</li>
                    <li>Added another small component of my own (for EE only) that sharpens the portraits for
                        Gromnir and Abazigal (for some reason, BG2EE sharpens all the other portraits, but not those
                        ones).</li>
                    <li>The cutscene in 'tougher Abazigal' is a bit of a mess; I've rebuilt it.</li>
                    <li>Restored the original Bhaalspawn powers as part of 'Restored Bhaalspawn powers': it doesn't
                        seem logical that you get new powers and Imoen gets old-style powers but you never get the
                        original ones.</li>
                    <li>Ascension now has an ini file that allows power-users fine control over some features of the
                        install. For instance, most of my tweaks that aren't straight bugfixes can be disabled
                        there, and I've externalized some other features, e.g. the XP thresholds to upgrade the
                        Slayer.</li>
                    <li>Very thoroughly documented the whole mod, including detailed information (behind a spoiler
                        link) on the effect of the difficulty slider.</li>
                    <li>Under the hood: complete recoding of Ascension</li>
                </ul>

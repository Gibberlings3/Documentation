                          README FOR THE Navarra ROMANCE MOD
                                     Navarra V 1
                                     
 This mod introduces Navarra, a human Barbarian to BG II. Navarra is chaotic good and will romance a male who is Elf, Half-elf, Human and of non
evil alignment.

Navarra grew up in the harsh land of Narfell. Slavery wasn't uncommon and her tribe was no exception. She doesn't like the slaves
but was tended to by them since childhood. Because she grew up around slaves, she believes men are weak-willed and beneath her.
She only knows what she was taught and what she experiences, living in the tribe. What she learned about men was instilled in her for many years.
Will she be able to handle, that with the events to come? Will a male PC be able to help her see the truth or even love her?
 
You can find Navarra in the Den of seven vales, towards the back.
She has a quest. Go to the bridge district to start it.
She isn't voiced, but has music tracks for romances.
She has banters with all Bioware NPC's and a friendship track as well.     
She also has an romance with an NPC. 

                              Compatibility

This mod is designed to work with Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal expansion pack. The mod should be compatible with other WeiDU mods.

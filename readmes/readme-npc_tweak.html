  <p><strong> Version 7 - <a href="http://gibberlings3.net/forums/index.php?app=downloads&showcat=44">Check
        for the most recent version</a></strong><br/>
          <strong>Languages:</strong> English, French, German, Polish, Russian, and Spanish <br/>
          <strong>Platforms:</strong> Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux</p>
</div>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<div class="section">
	<p>This mod tweaks original BG2 NPCs Anomen, Cernd, and Nalia, and as such can be run on BG2, BGT, BG2EE, and EET installs. It will have no effect on Tutu or EasyTutu games/NPCs, or on mod-added NPCs. </p>
</div>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>The <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Tweak mod changes
    certain aspects of Baldur's Gate II NPCs. It hopes to bring them more in
    line with the character presented, and/or to make them more useful without
    deviating from their character. Please note that none of these components
    will affect an <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> who is
    already in your party. For best results, it is recommended that you start
    a new game, or play from before having met the <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> in
    question. </p>
</div>
<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>This mod is designed to work with <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition">BG2EE</acronym> and with
    the original <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>: Shadows of Amn, with or without the expansion pack Throne of Bhaal.
    It will also work with the conversions BGT and EET. </p>
  <p>At the time of writing, there are known compatibility problems with The Darkest Day, but no other mods.
    Please report any compatibility issues you find as bugs. </p>
</div>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p><strong>Windows</strong><br />
    <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Tweak is packaged and
    installed with <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> and
    is distributed as a self-extracting archive. To install, simply double-click
    the archive and follow the instructions on screen. </p>
  <p> Alternatively the files can be extracted from the archive using <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/">WinRAR</a>.
    If properly extracted, you should have an <strong>npc_tweak</strong> folder and <strong>setup-npc_tweak.exe</strong>
    in your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder. To install,
    simply double-click <strong>setup-npc_tweak.exe</strong> and follow the instructions on screen. </p>
  <p> Please run <strong>setup-npc_tweak.exe</strong> in your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder
    to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components. </p>
  <p><strong>Mac OS X</strong><br />
    <em>If the mod was previously installed, uninstall it before extracting the
    new version. </em> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Tweak
    is packaged and installed with <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>.
    To install, simply extract the contents of the mod into your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder.&nbsp; If
    properly extracted, you should have an <strong>npc_tweak</strong> folder, <strong>setup-npc_tweak</strong>,
    and <strong>setup-npc_tweak.command</strong> in your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder.
    To install, simply double-click <strong>setup-npc_tweak.command</strong> and
    follow the instructions on screen.</p>
	<p>	<strong>Linux</strong><br />
Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify. Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="http://www.weidu.org/~thebigg "><acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>.org</a> and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal, cd to your BG2 installation directory, run 'tolower' and answer Y to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only this mod since the last time you lower cased file name. If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.<br />
Run <strong>WeInstall npc_tweak</strong> in your game folder to install the mod. Then run <strong>wine BGMain.exe</strong> and start playing.</p>

<h2>Contents</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Tweak contains the
    following components which can be installed independently of one another:</p>
  <p><strong>Anomen</strong><br />
    When Anomen is disowned by his father ("if you leave this house, you are
    a nameless dog not worthy to cower at my feet!"), why does he keep his family
    shield? Surely he should only be able to use it while he is a member of that
    family? Also, if he fails his knighthood test, he doesn't really get anything
    out of it - it is generally better to ignore roleplay and have him pass it.
    This component aims to correct these problems, and make the two paths equal
    from a powergaming perspective (leaving roleplay to choose between one path
    or the other). Anomen will now loose his family heirlooms (yes, plural -
    we also give him an extra one) if he disobeys his father. </p>
  <p> <strong>Cernd</strong><br />
    For lack of anything I've written myself, the following was posted in the
      forum for Idobek's <acronym title="Non-Player Character"><a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/npckit/">NPC
      Kitpack</a></acronym> mod (no relation): </p>
  <p> Cernd, the calm and collected druid, a shapeshifter? Changing into a raging
    machine of murder? That doesn't make much sense, I think. Totemic Druid suits
    him much better, I'd say. </p>
  <p> <strong>Nalia</strong><br />
    This component distributes Nalia's thief skills to better suit her life of
      sneaking out of the Keep. Her new thief skills are as follows: 60 Points
      in Open Locks (to get out of the Keep) 15 Points in Find/Disarm traps (because
      it uses similar tools to Open Locks, she will have a minor ability to do
      it) 40 Points in Move Silently (to not be noticed walking out) </p>

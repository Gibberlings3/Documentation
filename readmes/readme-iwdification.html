        <p><acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym>ification is a mod to   bring some of the elements of Icewind Dale into the Baldur's Gate series   of games. A lot of this project is based upon the work of the <a href="http://gibberlings3.net/forums/index.php?showforum=155"><acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym>-in-<acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym></a> conversion project, which later formed the backbone of IWDEE. </p>
        <p>The mod is currently an open beta so expect some bugs here and there. Please report them on the <a href="http://gibberlings3.net/forums/index.php?showforum=185">forums</a> so that they can be addressed. </p>

        <p><acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym>ification  works on all <acronym title="Infinity Engine">IE</acronym> games that use the Baldur's Gate II engine, which includes the original   Baldur's Gate II (Shadows of Amn with or without  Throne of Bhaal), the   two major Baldur's Gate conversion mods (Tutu and <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym>),   and the Enhanced Editions of Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate II. Content will be adjusted as   appropriate for the detected platform--e.g. no +5 items or ninth level   spells will be added to a Tutu or <acronym title="Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition">BGEE</acronym> game. </p>
        <p><strong>For EE games:</strong></p>
        <p> 
          All arcane and divine spells are available. In addition, the animations from IWD will be used for various summons--e.g. the shadows summoned by the spell Shades will use the IWD 'large shadow' animation, umber hulks and trolls from Monster Summoning will look like IWD hulks and trolls, etc. </p>
        <p><strong>For non-EE games: </strong></p>
        <p><a href="http://www.spellholdstudios.net/ie/tobex">TobEx</a> is   highly recommended for players using the spell packs on the original games. Without TobEx,   spell selection screens during character creation are limited to 24   spells, as are spellbook pages. Since there are more than 24 spells   available at some levels you will not be able to see all spells   available or be able to select them. Cat's Grace, a second-level arcane   spell, relies on functionality provided by TobEx and will be skipped if   it's not detected. </p>
        <p>The fourth-level divine spell Giant Insect relies on <a href="http://www.spellholdstudios.net/ie/infinityanimations">Infinity Animations</a>, as the beetles summoned by the spell do not have animations in the original <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>,   and will be skipped without the mod being installed. One of the summons   (yeti) for the sixth-level arcane spell Monster Summoning IV will not   be available without Infinity Animations, though the spell will   otherwise work with the other two summon options. Polymorph Self will also have an additional option, Boring Beetle, if IA is installed. If IWD animations are detected, they will be used for varous summons, as they are for EE games.</p>

      <p>If you should encounter any bugs, please report them to the authors at the <a href="http://gibberlings3.net/forums/index.php?showforum=185">IWDification</a> forum. In addition, IWDification is <a href="https://github.com/Gibberlings3/iwdification">available on GitHub</a>, so fixes and changes can be submitted by the community. </p>
      <h3>Known Issues</h3>
<p>Two-handed axes use the same combat and paperdoll animations as halberds. </p>
      <p>Contact Other Plane has no dialogue written, and is therefore unavailable at present. </p>
      <p>Arcane spell scrolls are only available in stores, and the new arcane and divine spells are currently not utilized by enemies. This is something that future versions will address. </p>
      <h3>Known Issues (Non-EE Games)</h3>
      <p>Many of the cosmetic effects for the new spells are too transparent; a review is planned for the next version. </p>
      <p>The Cat's Grace spell (part of the Arcane Spell Pack) requires <a href="http://www.spellholdstudios.net/ie/tobex">TobEx</a> for its unique dexterity modifications. Giant Insect (part of the Divine Spell Pack) requires the beetle animation, part of <a href="http://www.spellholdstudios.net/ie/infinityanimations">Infinity Animations</a>.   In addition, Monster Summoning IV (Arcane Spell Pack) will have yetis   as a summoning option if the yeti animation and Infinity Animations is   installed; otherwise the spell will still work with the other summoning   options. </p>
      <p>Just like <acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym>-in-<acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>,   a small number of spells cannot currently be converted at all. The     current list is: Seven Eyes, Soul Eater, (Great) Shout, Mordenkainen's     Force Missiles, Spiritual Wrath, Mold Touch, Wall of Moonlight, and     Smashing Wave. A few other spells are converted a bit suboptimally, and   don't work   quite the way they did in <acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym>. The current list is Blood Rage, Animal Rage, Static   Charge, and Whirlwind. Spells which use cloud (or cloud-like) projectiles are simulated in a very roundabout fashion; the upshot is that the visuals don't always reflect their actual area of effect and don't look as nice as they do in IWD or in the EE engine. </p>

      <p><strong>Special Note for Siege of Dragonspear from Steam/GOG<br />
      </strong>Good Old Games (GOG) and Steam both package the additional content for Siege of Dragonspear in a method that WeiDU, the tool used to install this mod, cannot access. You must  run a program called <a href="https://forums.beamdog.com/discussion/50441/modmerge-merge-your-steam-gog-zip-based-dlc-into-something-weidu-nearinfinity-dltcep-can-use/p1">Modmerge</a> on your SoD installation  before you can install this or any other WeiDU-based mod.      </p>
      <p><strong>Enhanced Editions Note</strong><br />
      The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every   patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a   modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as   even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with   your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a   new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language   version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod   will not show but give error messages. </p>
      <p><strong>Windows</strong><br />
        IWDification for Windows is distributed as a self-extracting   archive and includes a WeiDU installer. To install, simply double-click   the archive and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, the files can be extracted into your game directory using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a> or <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-iwdification.exe</strong> and the folder<strong>iwdification</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-iwdification.exe</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-iwdification.exe</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>Mac OS X</strong><br />
        IWDification for Mac OS X is distributed as a compressed tarball and includes a WeiDU installer.</p>
      <p>First, extract the files from the tarball into your game directory. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-iwdification</strong>, <strong>setup-iwdification.command</strong>, and the folder<strong>iwdification</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-iwdification.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-iwdification.command</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>Linux</strong><br />
        IWDification for Linux is distributed as a compressed tarball and does not include a WeiDU installer.</p>
      <p>Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.</p>
      <p>Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="http://www.weidu.org/%7Ethebigg/">WeiDU.org</a> and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal, cd to your game installation directory, run tolower   and answer Y to both queries. You can avoid running the second option   (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save   time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the   first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only   this mod since the last time you lowercased file names. If you're   unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.</p>
      <p>To install, run WeInstall iwdification in your game folder. Then run wine BGMain.exe and start playing. </p>
      <p><strong> Note for Complete Uninstallation</strong><br />
        In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely uninstall the mod using setup-iwdification --uninstall at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts.</p>

      <p><acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym>ification has several      components, which can be installed completely independently of one another. </p>
      <p><strong>Icewind Dale Casting Graphics (Andyr)</strong><br />
      <em>Also available in the Tweaks Anthology mod </em></p>
<p> When your character casts a spell, you get a pretty sequence of colors swirling      around their hand depending on the school the spell cast came from. A necromantic      spell, for example, looks quite different from creating an illusion. The      Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale games use different sets of animations for      the schools. This component changes the spellcasting animations to those      of Icewind Dale. Note that this is purely a cosmetic change--the spells      themselves function exactly as before. Screenshots for comparison are available      in the <a href="http://gibberlings3.net/forums/index.php?app=gallery&amp;album=27">Tweaks      gallery</a>. </p>
      <p><strong>Commoners Use Drab Colors</strong><br />
      <em>Also available in the Tweaks Anthology mod </em></p>
<p> Unlike Icewind Dale, commoners in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> wear      brightly colored clothes. This tweak changes the random selections of colors      for commoners to a drab palette. The dress of noblemen and noblewomen are      not affected. </p>
      <p><strong>Arcane Spell Pack</strong></p>
      <p> This component adds more than 30 arcane spells from Icewind Dale. This component does not alter existing <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> spells to match their <acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym> counterparts, except as noted below. <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/iwdification/arcane.php">Complete descriptions</a> are available on the project pages. </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Updated: </strong>Emotion, Hopelessness is updated to its IWD counterpart to match the other three new spells in the Emotion series. Polymorph Self gains two new forms, Polar Bear and Winter Wolf, and possibly a third, Boring Beetle, depending on your game. The fifth level elemental conjuring series is updated to its IWD counterpart to facilitate the addition of the water elemental spell. </li>

      </ul>
      <p><sup>1</sup> Only available for EE games<br />
      <sup>2</sup> Only available for EE games OR vanilla games with TobEx installed</p>
<p><strong>Divine Spell Pack </strong></p>
      <p> This component adds more than 40 divine spells from Icewind Dale and does not alter existing <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> spells to match their <acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym> counterparts. Divine spellcasters will receive these spells, as appropriate, in their spellbooks as they level up. Joinable <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> also receive updates to their spellbooks to account for the new spells. <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/iwdification/divine.php">Complete descriptions</a> are available on the project pages. </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Level 1:</strong> Cause Light Wounds, Curse, Sunscorch</li>

      </ul>
      <p><sup>1</sup> Only available for EE games<br />
      <sup>2</sup> Only available for EE games OR vanilla games with Infinity Animations installed</p>
<p><strong>Bard Song</strong></p>
      <p>Bards in Icewind Dale gained different bard songs as they leveled:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Ballad of Three Heroes - Available at level one, this   provides all allies with +1 to hit, +1 damage, and +1 to saving throws.</li>
        <li>The Tale of Curran Strongheart - Available at level three, this   song protects the party from fear and removes any current fear effects.</li>
        <li>Tymora's Melody - Available at level five, the party gains +1 luck, +3 to all saves, and +10 to lore and thieving skills.</li>
        <li>The Song of Kaudies - Available at level seven, this provides a   50% resistance to sound-based attacks and spells such as power words,   sirine charm, silence, and others.</li>
        <li>The Siren's Yearning - Available at level nine, this song   enthralls your foes, preventing action for five rounds on a failed save   vs. spell.</li>
        <li>War Chant of the Sith - Available at level 11, this provides +2 <acronym title="Armor Class">AC</acronym>, regeneration of two <acronym title="Hit Points">HP</acronym>/round, and 10% resistance to all crushing, missile, piercing, and slashing damage.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As the songs become available to the bard, the ability to freely   switch between them is available. This component only affects trueclass   bards, as the available kits use variants of <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> bard song for kit advantages and/or disadvantages. Bards with these new songs will not be able to pick Enhanced Bard Song as a high-level ability. </p>
      <p><strong>Two Handed Axes</strong></p>
      <p>Icewind Dale also featured two-handed axes, as opposed to the   strictly one-handed variety found in the Baldur's Gate series. This   component scatters normal and magical two-handed axes throughout the   game to make them available for players. Two-handed axes use the axe   proficiency and have base stats of 9 speed and <acronym title="1 roll of a 10-sided die">1d10</acronym> damage. Spoilers about their <a href="http://gibberlings3.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=29150&amp;p=258090">precise locations</a> are available on the forums. </p>

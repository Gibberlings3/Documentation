      <p> <strong>Special Note for Siege of Dragonspear from Steam/<abbr title="Good Old Games">GOG</abbr></strong><br />
        Good Old Games (<abbr title="Good Old Games">GOG</abbr>) and Steam both package the additional content for Siege of Dragonspear in a method that <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr>, the tool used to install this mod, cannot access. You must run a program called <a href="https://github.com/Argent77/A7-DlcMerger/releases"><abbr title="Downloadable Content">DLC</abbr> Merger</a> on your <abbr title="Siege of Dragonspear">SoD</abbr> installation before you can install this or any other <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr>-based mod. </p>
      <p> <strong>Enhanced Editions Note</strong><br />
        The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game&#39;s folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages. </p>
      <p> <strong>Windows</strong><br />
        Glam's NPC Pack for Windows is distributed as a self-extracting archive and includes a <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr> installer. To install, simply double-click the archive and follow the instructions on screen. </p>
      <p> Alternatively, the files can be extracted into your game directory using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a> or <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-glamnpcpack.exe</strong> and the folder <strong>glamnpcpack</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-glamnpcpack.exe</strong> and follow the instructions on screen. </p>
      <p> You can run <strong>setup-glamnpcpack.exe</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components. </p>
      <p> <strong>macOS</strong><br />
        Glam's NPC Pack for macOS is distributed as a compressed tarball and includes a <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr> installer. </p>
      <p> First, extract the files from the tarball into your game directory. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-glamnpcpack</strong>, <strong>setup-glamnpcpack.command</strong>, and the folder <strong>glamnpcpack</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-glamnpcpack.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen. </p>
      <p> You can run <strong>setup-glamnpcpack.command</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components. </p>
      <p> <strong>Linux</strong><br />
        Glam's NPC Pack for Linux is distributed as a compressed tarball and does not include a <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr> installer. Linux users will need to do a one-time install of <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr> (and a few other adjustments) as described in <a href="https://moebiusproject.gitlab.io/mods_on_linux">this great writeup</a>. </p>
      <p> To install, run &#39;WeInstall glamnpcpack in your game folder. </p>
      <p> <strong>Note for Complete Uninstallation</strong><br />
        In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely uninstall the mod using setup-glamnpcpack --uninstall at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts. </p>

      <h3>What is this?</h3>
      <p>The BGEE NPC Pack includes the original Vynd, Drow Assassin NPC mod as well as four brand new NPCs, all of whom will interact with each other and the classic Baldur's Gate cast. Each one includes a friendship track and an array of player-initiated dialogue, with more options opening up as the game progresses.</p>
      <p>You want quests? This time we got 'em! Three of the four new characters come with their own personal missions, which must be completed to unlock all their player-initiated dialogue, plus a final, loyalty-inspired talk in the endgame.</p>
      <p>You want loot? There's plenty of new and unique items to be had; some supplied with the characters, others found through their quests, or just indiscriminate slaughter. Hoard them all!</p>
      <p>You want romance? Nope. Sorry.</p>

However, while she is very much a product of the wilds, the mechanical, rapid-fire crossbow she carries is the work of her long-deceased father, once a master craftsman and wandering scholar. She is a walking contradiction, a juxtaposition of untamed nature and advanced technology.</p>

      <p>When asked about his past, Vynd wonders aloud how you'd feel if some nosy bastard you barely know asked for your life story. You've pieced together that he's not new to the surface world, and he left the Underdark by choice. Beyond that, he remains a mystery. A snide, abrasive mystery.</p>

      <p> When asked about her past, Moidre says little, which you've quickly   come to realise is normal for her. Her helmet, which she refuses to   remove even when ordered, hides her countenance from the world, and her   voice rarely wavers from its flat inflection, making her as easy to   engage with as a brick; however, her intense discipline marks her as   something more than common sellsword. </p>

      <p>When asked about his past, Dave chuckles and says it's not the past you should be interested in, but the present. Born to a single mother in a quiet village, Dave seems to have joined the church of Talos on a whim, for there was no outside force, nor troubled childhood, nor deranged power-hunger to compel him. Despite this, he expresses no doubts or regrets over his chosen path, and refuses to be swayed from it.</p>

      <p>Before you even had the chance to ask about her past, Flara insisted she was once a powerful red dragon, who is now trapped in human form. This may be true, or it may not; she can offer no concrete explanation for how such a predicament came about, nor does she recall much of her time before it. Nevertheless, the air around her ripples with heat, and her fiery breath is difficult to argue with, though not as much as her temperament.</p>

      <h3>Where do I find them?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li> <strong>Dave:</strong> Beregost, near the obelisk </li>
        <li><strong>Flara:</strong> Nashkel, Belching Dragon Inn </li>
        <li><strong>Littlun:</strong> Bear River (Area N of Gnoll Stronghold), southwest corner </li>
        <li><strong>Moidre:</strong> Beregost, Red Sheaf Inn </li>
        <li><strong>Vynd:</strong> Beregost, Burning Wizard Inn </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Do they fight with other <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym>?</h3>
      <p>Only Vynd and Kivan will come to blows, and it can be prevented by talking to Vynd before things escalate too far.</p>
      <h3>Anything else?</h3>
      <p>Flara and Moidre must be recruited before completing the Nashkel Mines! If they haven't joined your party before Chapter 3, they will disappear!</p>
      <p>While it is intended that none of these characters (except Littlun) care about the party's reputation, this feature still doesn't work in the Enhanced Edition. If you want to use them all together, I recommend installing the Happy Patch component of the <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/mods/tweaks/tweaks/">Tweaks Anthology</a>. It's okay. You're not breaking the rules.</p>
      <p>While Moidre is neutral, she responds best to a high reputation. If you want to get the most out of her, be good.</p>
      <p>Keep Gorion's letter! Having it in your inventory unlocks some additional player-initiated dialogues for each character.</p>
      <p>Don't tell Vynd you love him. You've been warned.</p>
      <h3>What if I just want Vynd?</h3>
      <p>Vynd is the same snarky drow he always was, and aside from his interactions with the new <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym>, nothing's changed. If you've played or intend to play the Vynd mod by itself, don't worry. You're not missing anything.</p>

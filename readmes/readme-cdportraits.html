      <p>There are five NPCs in the Baldur's Gate series who have multiple official portraits. Edwin, Imoen, Jaheira, Minsc, and Viconia all have different portraits for the BG and BG2 games; Imoen and Viconia have a third official portrait from Siege of Dragonspear. This mod will allow you to use any of these official portraits for them on any given game, e.g. you can use Imoen's BG portrait in BG2, or Viconia's SoD portrait in BG. The original and Enhanced Editions of Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate II are supported, as is Siege of Dragonspear and the various conversion projects involving these NPCs (EET, BGT, and Tutu). </p>
<p>The idea for this mod came about from a suggestion from Luke93 for a BG1 NPC component. AstroBryGuy handed the idea to me and, after a short afternoon of coding, voil&agrave;.  </p>

      <p>This mod works for the original or Enhanced Editions of Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate II, as is Siege of Dragonspear and the various conversion projects involving these NPCs (EET, BGT, and Tutu). There are currently no known incompatibilities, though note that the mod only seeks to override the default portrait names for these NPCs--if another mod changes Imoen's portrait assignment to a different filename, this mod's changes will not appear in game.</p>

      <p><strong>Special Note for Siege of Dragonspear from Steam/GOG<br />
        </strong>Good Old Games (GOG) and Steam both package the additional content for Siege of Dragonspear in a method that WeiDU, the tool used to install this mod, cannot access. You must  run a program called <a href="https://forums.beamdog.com/discussion/50441/modmerge-merge-your-steam-gog-zip-based-dlc-into-something-weidu-nearinfinity-dltcep-can-use/p1">Modmerge</a> on your SoD installation  before you can install this or any other WeiDU-based mod. </p>
      <p><strong>Enhanced Editions Note</strong><br />
        The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every   patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a   modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as   even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with   your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a   new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. For BG:EE it is important that you install the mod to the language   version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod   will not show but give error messages. </p>
      <p><strong>Windows</strong><br />
        Continuous NPC Portraits for Windows is distributed as a self-extracting   archive and includes a WeiDU installer. To install, simply double-click   the archive and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, the files can be extracted into your game directory using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a> or <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-cdportraits.exe</strong> and the folder <strong>cdportraits</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-cdportraits.exe</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-cdportraits.exe</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>Mac OS X</strong><br />
        The Continuous NPC Portraits for Mac OS X is distributed as a compressed tarball and includes a WeiDU installer.</p>
      <p>First, extract the files from the tarball into your game directory. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-cdportraits</strong>, <strong>setup-cdportraits.command</strong>, and the folder <strong>cdportraits</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-cdportraits.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-cdportraits.command</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>Linux</strong><br />
        The Continuous NPC Portraits for Linux is distributed as a compressed tarball and does not include a WeiDU installer.</p>
      <p>Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.</p>
      <p>Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="http://www.weidu.org/%7Ethebigg/">WeiDU.org</a> and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal, cd to your game installation directory, run tolower   and answer Y to both queries. You can avoid running the second option   (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save   time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the   first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only   this mod since the last time you lowercased file names. If you're   unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.</p>
      <p>To install, run WeInstall cdportraits in your game folder. Then run wine BGMain.exe and start playing. </p>
      <p><strong> Note for Complete Uninstallation</strong><br />
        In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely uninstall the mod using setup-cdportraits --uninstall at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts. . </p>

      <p>The idea from the mod came from a suggestion from Luke93 to AstroBryGuy on the Beamdog forums for the BG1 NPC Project, and it was subsequently handed off to me. Thanks to both Luke93 for the idea, and for AstroBryGuy for alerting me to it. </p>
<p>As always, a big thanks to the wonderful community at <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/">The
        Gibberlings Three</a>. It's easy to keep working when we have such great players and modders. </p>

      <p>The modding community for the Infinity Engine has been going strong for
        more than 10 years now, and is the culmination of thousands of unpaid modding
        hours by fellow fans of the game. Modders produce their best work and players
        get the best, well-supported mods when we all work together. </p>
      <p> There are two big ways to upset this harmony. One is to claim someone else's
        work as your own. The second is to host and redistribute a mod without permission
        from the author(s). </p>
      <p> Be kind to your fellow players and modders. Don't do either. </p>

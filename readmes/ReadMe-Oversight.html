<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>Have you ever played a paladin in Baldur's Gate II?</p>
  <p>I have.</p>
  <p>Have you ever played a paladin all the way through Baldur's Gate I as your
    first character, relied heavily on Detect Evil, imported the character to
    Baldur's Gate II, and realized before you got out of the starting dungeon
    that Something Was Terribly Wrong?</p>
  <p>I have.</p>
  <p>A lot of the alignment codings in Baldur's Gate II are, to put it nicely,
    insane. Good brigands and murderers. Neutral paladins. Evil actors, major-domos,
    Priests of Lathander, and other characters who are entirely helpful and friendly.
    The Alignment Correction component of this mod was written to correct these
    errors.</p>
  <p>Additionally, in Throne of Bhaal, David Gaider created excellent Tougher
    versions of four members of the Five, which are most conveniently available
    as part of Ascension-<acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>,
    located at <a href="http://www.weidu.org/">http://www.weidu.org</a> , but
    no Tougher version of Sendai, Throne of Bhaal's ultimate spellcaster. Already
    markedly weaker than her brother Abazigal, whom players could encounter before
    facing her, Sendai became the weakest of the Five when all existing Tougher
    versions were installed. The Tougher Sendai component strives to rectify
    this, making Sendai approximately as deadly as Tougher Abazigal.</p>

<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>This mod is designed to work with <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>:
    Shadows of Amn, with or without the expansion pack Throne of Bhaal. The Cleric
    Kits component will not work with the Multiple Stronghold component of the
    Ease-of-Use or <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> Tweak Pack
    mods. It will, however, work with the <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Strongholds
    mod.</p>
</div>

</div>
<h2>Contents</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p> Oversight contains the following components which can be installed independently
    of one another:</p>
  <p><strong>Alignment Correction</strong><br />
    This component will change the alignments of the 700-some-odd creature files
      with alignments that seem at odds with their <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> behavior.
      This component changes the creature files to the alignments I believe make
      most sense for them; this is inevitably a judgment call.</p>
  <p>Be aware that this component will only change those creatures whom your
    character has not yet seen. If you wish to experience the full effects of
    the mod (that is, if you simply can't live with having killed a Neutral Good
    otyugh in the starting dungeon), you will need to begin a new game after
    installing. However, every miscoded character whose first appearance is after
    installation of this mod will be corrected, and every miscoded character
    (including the otyugh) will be corrected in any future games you play.</p>
  <p>If you feel the mod is good for the most part but that I've changed a coding
    in error, or left a coding alone in error, feel free to email me. However,
    be aware of the following principles this component depends on:</p>
  <ol>
    <li> Inherent evil makes for lame stories. An email which goes, &quot;But
      you can't make X good/evil, all members of that species are evil/good&quot; is
      unlikely to sway me. I'll be far more likely to make changes you suggest
      if your argument takes the form, &quot;This character should be evil/good/chaotic/lawful/neutral
      because in the game she does x, y, and z.&quot;</li>
    <li> The original coding of the game characters is a bad joke. &quot;There
      isn't a compelling enough reason to change the coded alignment of that
      character&quot; is unlikely to sway me. Any reason at all, down to and
      including &quot;That looks like a Chaotic hairstyle to me,&quot; is more
      compelling than the game's original coding.</li>
    <li>I will not tread on another modder's toes. Don't ask me to make WeimerSolaufein
      or Ascension Balthazar Lawful Neutral, or to change anything else from
      a mod. Make your case instead to Westley Weimer (for Solaufein), David
      Gaider (for Ascension), or the designer of the mod in question (other mods).</li>
    <li> Good &ne; Nice. Just because a character is rude does not mean that
      character is evil. It doesn't even imply that that character is not good.</li>
    <li> Tabletop D&amp;D was not consulted for any of these. I've been playing
      D&amp;D for twenty years, and I've never played in a game without house
      rules. If a character's actions in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> indicate
      a different alignment from a D&amp;D supplement (a character listed in
      a supplement as Neutral who acts blatantly evil in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>,
      for example), I take that to indicate that BioWare changed the character
      and accordingly changed the character's proper alignment, rather than that
      the actions are to be ignored.</li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>Class Tweaks/Fixes <br />
    </strong>This component changes those creature files with weird/inappropriate
    classes. I expect this component to be far more controversial than the Alignment
    Correction component. I doubt anyone will disagree that kobold shamans and
    hobgoblin captains shouldn't be coded as paladins, but what I do expect to
    draw more dissent is my reassigning of the Innocent class.</p>
  <p>I consider this mod component entirely a fix as many of the class codings
    are just as insane as the alignment codings; however, I realize some others
    will disagree, so I've named it Tweaks/Fixes. Call the changes tweaks or
    fixes (or something unprintable if you'd rather), as you please.</p>
  <p>As with the Alignment Correction component, you are free to send me an email
    and make a case that I've changed a class inappropriately. However, again,
    there are some principles you should take into account.</p>
  <ol>
    <li> Reputation serves a dual function in the Baldur's Gate series: It reflects
      how you are seen, as its name suggests, but it also reflects how good you
      actually are. I use the coding &quot;Innocent&quot; primarily to reflect
      the latter, and I believe the game's coding, schizophrenic as it is, supports
      the idea that this is the true purpose of the class. I am thus unlikely
      to be convinced by arguments that take the form, &quot;So-and-so shouldn't
      be an Innocent because no one would ever know if I killed him,&quot; or, &quot;so-and-so
      should be an Innocent because even if she's evil she's still a respected
      member of the community.&quot; I take the position that a plurality of
      characters in the world are True Neutral. Some Neutral and Good characters
      may be unpleasant, but if a character is actually Evil with the Alignment
      Correction component of this mod, he or she is guilty of something bad
      enough that some people will consider you a hero if it becomes known you
      killed that character.</li>
    <li>This component is written for a world affected by the Alignment Correction
      component. &quot;He shouldn't be an Innocent because he's evil&quot; is
      a compelling argument for me to change one of those qualities in the character
      in question--but only if the character is an &quot;evil Innocent&quot; when
      both the Alignment Correction and Class Tweaks/Fixes component is installed.</li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>Tougher Sendai <br />
    </strong>This component will make Sendai an opponent on par with the rest
    of the Tougher versions of the Five. It will change her stats to match those
    of the Sendai, who appears for the final battle in the Ascension mod, and
    give her equipment and spell choices that enable her to make full use of
    her powers.</p>
  <p>If you play on Core or below, she functions with strict limits on what she
    can or cannot do. On Hard or Insane, she is much more interested in kicking
    your ass than in being &quot;fair&quot; about it. Hopefully, you should notice
    a marked increase in the difficulty of the fight on any difficulty setting,
    but the tactics and abilities she uses will be different for each difficulty
    setting. (If you are curious, <a href="http://gibberlings3.net/forums/?showtopic=2549">a
    list of the differences is available</a>, but I strongly advise against looking
    at it before you fight Sendai, as it will ruin the surprise for you.)</p>
  <p>Within the limits of <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>'s <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym>,
    she attempts to be as deadly as an intelligently played <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym>.
    This is not a game to her; even on Novice, she has no compunction about abusing
    the engine to achieve the Greater Good of kicking your ass and thus saving
    her own. If you can think of anything that you think would be an effective
    tactic for a character with her stats in her situation and that she does
    not already do, by all means, email it to me. If you can think of tactics
    that work on her that ought not to work on an intelligent opponent, let me
    know as well.</p>
  <p><strong>Altered Spells<br />
    </strong>This component revises three of the spells in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> which
    are too weak to be worth casting. A ranger's Charm Animals ability will now
    automatically and permanently befriend every animal on the map. Know Alignment
    now targets every character on the map, like Detect Evil, and allows no save.
    It also detects lawful or chaotic alignment, instead of just good and evil.
    Comet is now unaffected by magic resistance and the damage it inflicts is
    crushing, making it no longer a weaker choice than Dragon's Breath for every
    situation.</p>
  <p><strong>Improved Continuity</strong><br />
    This component changes the soundset of the final villain of Shadows of Amn,
      in the final battle, to the soundset he's used throughout the game, instead
      of the ogre soundset he currently uses. It also prevents Saemon Havarian
      from returning in Throne of Bhaal if he has died in Shadows of Amn (and
      only if he has died--dark and terrible rumors suggest some people actually
      like him; if you didn't kill him in <acronym title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</acronym>,
      you don't need to worry about him failing to show up in <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym>).</p>
  <p><strong>Cleric Kits <br />
    </strong>In Baldur's Gate II, clerics can choose a kit, and gain a stronghold,
    based on one component of their alignment--Good clerics serve Lathander,
    Neutral clerics serve Helm, and Evil clerics serve Talos. However, while
    Lathander works as a blanket Good deity, Helm is perhaps the single most
    intensely Lawful deity in the Realms, and this shows in his stronghold quests.
    This component has four effects:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>It changes the alignment restrictions to serve each of the deities to
      go with the alignments of the deities. Lathander's alignment requirements
      are unchanged, Helm accepts worshipers of any Lawful alignment or True
      Neutral, and Talos accepts worshipers of Chaotic Evil, Chaotic Neutral,
      or Neutral Evil alignment. Chaotic Neutral Anomen stands as an anomaly,
      but since Sir Anomen is an anomaly in the unmodded game, it makes little
      difference.</li>
    <li> It fixes a longstanding and infamous bug that prevents cleric/rangers
      from being recognized as part cleric for stronghold purposes.</li>
    <li> It offers a cleric stronghold (Lathander, or Helm, as appropriate to
      alignment) to monks, as well. Monks still have the option of taking the
      fighter stronghold instead.</li>
    <li> It changes the holy symbols cleric party members get to go with the
      new alignment requirements of the deities, so that a Lawful Evil <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym> will
      get a Holy Symbol of Helm which works for Lawful and Neutral <acronym title="Player Characters">PCs</acronym> while
      a Chaotic Neutral <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym> will get
      a Holy Symbol of Talos which works for clerics within one step of Chaotic
      Evil.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Be warned that this component will not work with the Multiple Stronghold
    component of the Ease-of-Use or <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> Tweak
    Pack mods. It will, however, work with the <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Strongholds
    mod and with the Holy Symbol Fix component of Ding0's Tweak Pack.</p>
  <p><strong>Monk High Level Abilities <br />
    </strong>In unmodded Throne of Bhaal, monks have access to the same pool
    of High Level Abilities as fighters. This seems lame. This component will
    give monks their own set of High Level Abilities instead, most of which should
    be quite familiar to anyone who has played through Throne of Bhaal before.</p>
  <p><em>Shadowless Kick</em><br />
    This kick throws the target back, knocks the target unconscious, and deals <acronym title="4 rolls of an 8-sided die">4d8</acronym> points
    of damage.</p>
  <p><em>Tiger Strike</em><br />
    A more powerful form of Shadowless Kick, this power ensures every blow for
      the next round is a critical hit. In addition, every blow for the next
      two rounds throws the target back and knocks the target unconscious. <br />
    Prerequisite: Shadowless Kick.</p>
  <p><em>Dragon Fist</em><br />
    With a blow, the monk strips away the magical protections of the target.</p>
  <p><em>Faster Than The Eye</em><br />
    By concentrating briefly on another area within 4000 feet, the monk can instantly
      transport herself there. <br />
    Prerequisite: Feet of the Wind.</p>
  <p><em>Flip Resistances</em><br />
    The monk's magic resistance converts into physical damage resistance for
      a number of rounds equal to twice the monk's level. The monk also becomes
      immune to backstab for the same duration.</p>
  <p><em>Solar Stance</em><br />
    Solar Stance renders nearby enemies more vulnerable, reducing the saving
      throws of any within 60 feet of the monk by 4. It creates a cloud of glittering
      golden particles that fill the air for twenty feet around the monk, revealing
      invisible creatures. All enemies in the cloud must roll a successful saving
      throw vs. spell or be blinded (-4 to attack rolls, saving throws, and Armor
      Class) until the dust fades, after 4 rounds. Also, a blast of fire emanates
      from the monk, scorching and throwing back everyone in a 30 foot radius,
      though the stance protects the monk from the flames.<br />
    Prerequisite: Tiger Strike.</p>
  <p><em>Lunar Stance</em><br />
    A monk who strikes this stance gains a +5 bonus to Saving Throws vs. Death,
      a + 2 bonus to luck, and becomes immune to Slay, Imprisonment, Petrification,
      Level Drain, Disintegrate, and Time Stop. The duration of this power is
      four rounds.<br />
    Prerequisite: Solar Stance.</p>
  <p><em>Shadow Stance</em><br />
    This stance causes the monk to instantly become both invisible, as per the
      spell Improved Invisibility, and immune to divination spells such as True
      Seeing. This power lasts for 23 rounds.<br />
    Prerequisite: Lunar Stance.</p>
  <p><em>Feet of the Wind</em><br />
    Each time this ability is chosen, it greatly and permanently increases the
      monk's movement rate.</p>
  <p><em>Second Wind</em><br />
    By concentrating briefly, the monk can shrug off even the worst of wounds,
      once per day. The effect of this power is to fully heal the monk instantly. <br />
    Prerequisite: Flip Resistances.</p>
  <p><em>Stunning Blow</em><br />
    The monk has one more use of the Stunning Blow ability per day.</p>
  <p><em>Quivering Palm</em><br />
    The monk has one more use of the Quivering Palm ability per day.</p>
  <p><strong>Holy Liberator Kit <br />
    </strong>This component adds a new paladin kit to the game, a conversion
    of a 3ed D&amp;D Prestige Class.</p>
  <p>A Holy Liberator is a cousin to the paladin, dedicated to the overthrow
    of tyranny. These champions of freedom are strong-willed, independent-minded,
    and virtuous.</p>
  <p> In most respects, Holy Liberators are much like paladins. However, they
    shun positions of leadership and value wisdom over charisma. The trademark
    quality of the Holy Liberator is that their nature is entirely hostile to
    mind control abilities, whether those abilities are used by putative allies
    or enemies.</p>
  <p> Holy Liberators are as intensely dedicated to Chaotic Good as paladins
    are to Lawful Good. For both, goodness is paramount, but while paladins follow
    carefully codified rules of conduct, Holy Liberators follow their own consciences.
    However, the standards they hold themselves to are no less strict.</p>
  <p>Advantages:<br />
    - Immune to Charm.<br />
    - Gains Subversion ability, which temporarily protects all in the surrounding
    area, regardless of allegiance, from mind-affecting powers, once per day
    per four levels, starting at first level with one use.</p>
  <p>Disadvantages:<br />
    - Cannot Lay On Hands.</p>

  <p>This mod incorporates the Detectable Spells mod, which was created by Vulgar
    Zildrah and Kensai Ryu and packaged by Eric &quot;Cirerrek&quot; Kerr, with
    permission. If you install Tougher Sendai, you will have Detectable Spells
    installed as well, whether you did beforehand or not; it will make no difference

  <p>Cam revised the mod's coding to be far more efficient and to make all the
    components work without Throne of Bhaal. He also created the icons used by
    the Monk High Level Abilities. Joost rearranged the Monk High Level Abilities
    and fixed the bug that made Second Wind unselectable. Gospel created the
    item which prevents Sendai from dying before her Chain Contingency goes off.
    SimDing0 implemented the checks for Lawful and Chaotic alignment in the Know

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions </h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>Q: Hey! I wanted the animals to be friendly!<br />
    A: You can still have them friendly easily enough. Just install Altered Spells
      and play a ranger, or take Minsc or Valygar.</p>
  <p>Q: Monks get all these new powers and the fighter high level abilities too?!<br />
    A: No, monks do not still get any of the fighter high level abilities.</p>
  <p>Q: Aren't these new monk high level abilities just a port of Balthazar's
    powers? Isn't that unbalanced?<br />
    A: Most of them resemble Balthazar's powers, but few (only one actually)
    of them are direct translations, and in that case, it's because I felt that
    that power worked perfectly as a <acronym title="High Level Ability">HLA</acronym> without
    alteration. I gave careful thought to balance, and while they are more powerful
    than, say, War Cry, I consider them appropriately balanced with Whirlwind/Greater
    Whirlwind, Critical Strike, and Dragon's Breath. A monk with these powers
    is more powerful than a monk with fighter <acronym title="High Level Abilities">HLAs</acronym>,
    but that is because these powers are tailored to a monk while the fighter <acronym title="High Level Abilities">HLAs</acronym> are
    tailored to a fighter.</p>
  <p>Q: I just used Charm Animals at Trademeet and now everyone is attacking
    me! What is this?<br />
    A: The people of Trademeet locked Cernd up for being a druid, because they
    saw someone directing the animals attacking the town. Even if you act completely
    civilized, some of them are suspicious of you. You just walked in and demonstrated
    to the whole town that you, just like their assailant, have the power to
    control the animals who have been attacking them. This is a suboptimal way
    to make a good first impression.</p>

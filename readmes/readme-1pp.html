<p> This mod changes the paperdolls and inventory icons of Baldur's Gate II to those of Baldur's Gate. There's a lot of stuff in Baldur's Gate 2 (especially in the <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym> expansion) that simply doesn't live up to the artwork quality that Baldur's Gate offered--the paperdolls are a good example. If it's just been sloppy work on the developer side, or something else, I do not know. To replace exactly these parts of the game with something that lives up to the quality we were used from the original. So, technically this is an attempt to fix flaws the developers did. </p>
<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<p>This tweak pack is designed to work with Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn with or without the Throne of Bhaal expansion pack. The mod should also work with Tutu. </p>

    <strong>Languages:</strong> English<br />
    <strong>Platforms: </strong>Windows, Linux, Mac OS X</p>
</div>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>This mod is one big rework of the armour system of <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>, <acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym> and Tutu, and a small collection of tweaks, dependent or not.</p>
</div>
<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>This mod is designed to work with Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn with
    or without the Throne of Bhaal expansion pack, and Icewind Dale with or
    without any of the Heart of Winter and Trials of the Luremaster expansions.
    Also compatible with EasyTutu SoA and ToB, with or without
    Tales of the Sword Coast.</p>
  <p><strong>Known incompatibilites (main component):</strong> <ul>
   <li>Refinements' Revised Armors & Shields</li>
   <li>BG2 Tweaks' Allow Thieving and Stealth in Heavy Armor</li>
   <li>IWD Tweaks' Allow Thieving and Stealth in Heavy Armor</li>
   <li>Item Revisions' Heavy Armor Encumbrance</li>
   <li>Item Revisions' Allow Thieving Skills in Armor</li>
  </ul></p>

 <p><strong>Install order:</strong></p>

 <p>As close to last as you can manage. After anything adding armours to the game. Definitely after Spell Revisions, Item Revisions, Galactygon's SpellPack Beta 5.
    See <a href="http://gibberlings3.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=16250">the forum thread</a> for more info.</p>

</div>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p><strong>Windows</strong><br />
    The Full Plate And Packing Steel mod is packaged
    and installed with <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> and
    is distributed as a self-extracting archive. To install, simply double-click
    the archive and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
  <p>Alternatively the files can be extracted from the archive using <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/">WinRAR</a>.
    If properly extracted, you should have a fullplate folder and setup-fullplate.exe
    in your game folder. To install,
    simply double-click setup-fullplate.exe and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
  <p>Please run setup-fullplate.exe in your game folder
    to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
  <p><strong>Mac OS X</strong><br />
    <em>If the mod was previously installed, uninstall it before extracting the
    new version.</em>The Full Plate And Packing Steel mod
    is packaged and installed with <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>.
    To install, simply extract the contents of the mod into your game folder.
    If properly extracted, you should have a fullplate folder, setup-fullplate,
    and setup-fullplate.command in your game folder.
    To install, simply double-click <strong>setup-fullplate.command</strong> and
    follow the instructions on screen.</p>
   <p><strong>Linux</strong><br />
    Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify. Download the latest
    version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="http://www.weidu.org/~thebigg "><acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>.org</a>
    and copy WeiDU, WeInstall and tolower to somewhere in your path (/usr/local/bin/ or /usr/bin/ , for example).
    Following that, open a terminal, cd to your game installation directory, run 'tolower' and answer Y to both queries.</p>
   <p>You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already run it once in the same directory.
    To save time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the first option
    (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only this mod since the last time you lowercased filenames.
    If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.</p>
   <p>Run <strong>WeInstall fullplate</strong> in your game folder to install the mod.
    Then run <strong>wine bgmain.exe</strong> or <strong>wine idmain.exe</strong> and start playing.</p>

<p><strong>Between You And Harm: Armour System Rework</strong></p>

<p>AD&amp;D's armour system never made sense to me. Characters as agile and sprightly in full plate as in light leather armour. Heavy armour not helping one bit if a goblin happens to hit you in the chest with a bent butterknife. You get hurt just as bad as the random unarmoured commoner.</p>

<p>And in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>, <acronym title="Armor Class">AC</acronym> simply isn't effective after a while. Opponents  autohit you and you them, because of AC not keeping pace with  THAC0 and pluses to hit and whatnot accumulating.</p>

<p>Enter this rework. Light, enchanted armours actually help you dodge and take a bit of the sting out. Heavy, enchanted armours don't help dodging much. But they absorb perhaps half or more of the blow in exchange for slowing you down and fatiguing you. Armour spells and potions are modified to match the systematic changes.</p>

<p>Stealth, thieving and casting in heavy armour is possible,  but difficult.</p>

<p>Heavy armour has quite another feel now. Enjoy.</p>

<p>P.S. Do read the updated descriptions. They are informative. See <a href="#designnotes">the design notes</a> below if you want full details.</p>

<p><acronym title="Heart of Winter">HOW</acronym>/<acronym title="Trials of the Luremaster">TOTLM</acronym> note: The (x amount resisted) feedback text does not  seem to be accurate all the time. Strangeness abounds. But it  all seems to work correctly.</p>

<p><strong>Field Improvisation</strong></p>

<p>Allows all magical armours and other items of protection to be worn with each other.</p>

<p><strong>Little He Knows Where a Foe May Lurk</strong></p>

<p>Everyone can backstab at x2, thieves/assassins/stalkers do better. Only weapons a single-class thief can use are eligible for backstab, as usual.</p>

                                   README FOR THE CALIN ROMANCE MOD
                                      Calin V 1.0
                                   

This mod introduces Calin, a human Blade Master to BG II. Calin is neutral good and will romance a female who is Elf, Half-elf, Human and of non
evil alignment.

He has banters with all Bioware NPC's and a friendship track as well.

He has some crossmod content with Neh'taniel but only if Calin is installed after Neh'taniel.

Calin has a serious issue with thieves and his comments through the game are harsh, but he has a reason for that. He will romance female thieves but,
he will ask the PC to make a sacrifice for the romance to happen... if the PC has the thief stronghold.   

IF the PC is a thief, but doesn't meet the romance requirements, he will leave the group if you accept the thief stronghold.

Compatibility

This mod is designed to work with Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn with or without the Throne of Bhaal expansion pack and with the Enhanced Edition of Baldur's Gate II. The mod should be compatible with other WeiDU mods.

Bug Reporting

If you should encounter any bugs, please report them to the author at the Calin forum.
Installation

Enhanced Editions Note

The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches.

Windows

Calin for Windows is distributed as a self-extracting archive and includes a WeiDU installer. To install, simply double-click the archive and follow the instructions on screen.

Alternatively, the files can be extracted into your game directory using 7zip or WinRAR. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain setup-Calin.exe and the folder Calin. To install, double-click setup-Calin.exe and follow the instructions on screen.

You can run setup-Calin.exe in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.

Mac OS X

Calin for Mac OS X is distributed as a compressed tarball and includes a WeiDU installer.

First, extract the files from the tarball into your game directory. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain setup-Calin, setup-Calin.command, and the folderCalin. To install, double-click setup-Calin.command and follow the instructions on screen.

You can run setup-Calin.command in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.

Linux

Calin for Linux is distributed as a compressed tarball and does not include a WeiDU installer.

Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.

Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from WeiDU.org and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal, cd to your game installation directory, run tolower and answer Y to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only this mod since the last time you lowercased file names. If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.

To install, run WeInstall Calin in your game folder. Then run wine BGMain.exe and start playing.

Note for Complete Uninstallation

In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely uninstall the mod using setup-Calin --uninstall at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts. .

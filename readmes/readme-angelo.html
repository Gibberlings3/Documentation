<h2>Introduction</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>‘Where's my old gang done gone?' <br />
    I heard a sad man say, <br />
    I whispered in that sad man's ear, <br />
‘Your gang's done gone away.' </p>
  <p>—Kurt Vonnegut, <em>Cat's Cradle </em></p>
  <p>“The past is the present, isn't it? It's the future too.” </p>
  <p>Eugene O'Neil, <em>Long Day's Journey Into Night </em></p>
  <p>Angelo Dosan is the fighter-turned-mage who served as your brother's henchman
    in Baldur's Gate. You may remember that he sentenced you to death and fought
    against you in the Undercity, and if you were lucky enough to mine the content,
    you may remember that he is Shar-Teel's father. Most likely he didn't survive
    your game, but people in this world seem to have a knack for not staying
    dead. </p>
  <p>In the Angelo <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Mod, Angelo
    tracks you down in the Graveyard District to make you an offer you can't
    refuse (though perhaps you will). He comes equipped with the following: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Between two and five banters with every Bioware <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>,
      except for Cernd (none) and Mazzy (one) </li>
    <li>Extensive player-initiated conversation trees </li>
    <li>A full array of interjections </li>
    <li>Voicing </li>
    <li>Custom equipment </li>
    <li>A new merchant </li>
    <li>For those curious about the past, the player can ask Angelo to unfold
      the story of Sarevok as he saw it. Of course, should Sarevok himself ever
      join the party, the plot may thicken. </li>
    <li>Angelo has two major quests—both in <acronym title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</acronym>,
      one of which can carry into <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym>. </li>
    <li>If you are female, are of <strong>any </strong> race and have at least
      twelve charisma, you can attempt to romance Angelo. It's a rocky road,
      but may reward players looking for something different. </li>
  </ul>

<h2>About Angelo</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>Angelo is Chaotic Neutral. He feels little remorse for the past, but has
    no objection to giving virtue a try; and in everything looks out for himself.
    As his new “chief,” he wants to see the <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym> succeed
    (as long as the <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym> doesn't set
    his sights too high, as Sarevok did), and can't understand why the <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym> insists
    on running around with a gang of oddballs after risky objectives, rather
    than settling down and building his or her fortune. He has little to no taste
    for adventure, and respects experience and competence. </p>
</div>
<h2>Sample Dialogue</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>“I give you my word. You can always trust a rogue's word; it's all he has.
    I didn't betray your brother, even once I realized he was the craziest bastard
    I had ever met and would most likely kill me one day. Why? I was afraid of
    him. And you, from the looks of it, are a harder fellow than he was.” </p>
  <p>&quot;Gods, man. Dragons? Joust away. Mad ghosts? I'm right behind you.
    Bureaucracy? We can find you another childhood pal.” </p>
</div>
<h2><acronym title="Frequently Asked Questions">FAQ</acronym></h2>
<div class="section">
  <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: Is Angelo <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>?<br />
    <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: Yes. </p>
  <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: Is the mod compatible? <br />
    <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: Yes. </p>
  <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: Angelo's name or soundest is messed
    up! <br />
    <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: Select Angelo in the game and press “K.” This
    should fix the problem. </p>
  <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: I'm having trouble installing Angelo
    on my Mac. I try using the install command but I just get an error message. <br />
    <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: I, the author, am a Mac user, and I
    had this problem myself. I'm told you can either use “StuffIt” to expand
    the archive, or this process (suggested by a player of Kulyok's Xan <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>)
    worked for me: </p>
  <ol>
    <li> Open the Terminal, type ‘chmod +x' followed by a space, drag Setup-Angelo.command
      into the window, press enter. </li>
    <li> Type ‘chmod 755' followed by a space, drag Setup-Angelo into the window,
      press enter. </li>
    <li> Double-click Setup-Angelo.command, the installation process should now
      proceed.</li>
  </ol>
  <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: Angelo isn't just going to betray
    me, is he? I don't think I could handle that again. <br />
    <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: Of course I can't say absolutely, but
    rest assured, if you want him he's in for the long haul. </p>
  <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: Why can't I take off Angelo's clothes? <br />
    <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: For a number of reasons, both balance-related
    and aesthetic, this seemed to me the best solution. </p>
  <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: What good is Angelo combat-wise? <br />
    <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: I always thought fighter-mages were
    under-utilized in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym>—Haer'Dalis
    is one of the few. For example, a lot of neat defensive spells are caster-only,
    and some of the later spells (like energy drain) are touch range...but basically,
    Angelo is a competent fighter and a competent mage, he can use katanas, and
    he should fall somewhere between Valygar and Haer'Dalis in style. He has
    seven levels in fighter and advances as mage. </p>
  <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: Angelo has no dual-wielding dots!
    Why? <br />
    <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: It just isn't his style; he only had
    seven levels of fighter to learn to use one weapon effectively, and he isn't
    the strongest or most dexterous guy. If you really want, you can start putting
    dots there. </p>
  <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: Is there anyone I should take in
    my party to get the most of the content? <br />
    <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: Angelo has a bond with characters from
    the previous game. I would STRONGLY recommend taking Imoen. Jaheira, Keldorn,
    Minsc, Edwin and Valygar are also good picks, and Haer'Dalis contributes
    to the romance (this takes some time to pay off, but I would argue that it
    is worth it). There is a romance conflict with Anomen, though not an epic
    one. Taking on Sarevok is recommended in <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym>. </p>
  <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: My favorite character doesn't get
    picked on, does he/she? <br />
    <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: Angelo has his own likes and dislikes
    (which he will be quite vocal about), but honestly, I don't have a strong
    personal bias against anyone. I think I tried to keep things balanced (except
    for Cernd).* </p>
  <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: I can understand taking him along,
    but why on earth would my <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym>,
    poor [CHARNAME], want to romance him? <br />
    <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: This is an excellent question that Angelo
    himself will raise. There is someone for everyone, though, and Angelo may
    be just what a certain <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym> is
    looking for. </p>
  <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: Any tips on playing the romance? <br />
    <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: Angelo may seem slow to come around.
    You are given plenty of opportunities to break off the romance but it can
    potentially last until the epilogue. When the gift horse comes knocking,
    don't look it in the mouth. </p>
  <p>Aside from a charisma of 12+, there are no restrictions on the romance,
    alignment or racial. However the <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym>'s
    responses tend to be articulate, so it might not make sense to do it with
    your INT 6 half-orc. Likewise, it might not make sense for a <em>very </em> evil
    character, unless you plan to cruelly string him along with lies (which is
    quite possible). The responses offered should cover a nice spectrum from
    lawful good to neutral or lawful evil. </p>
  <p>IMPORTANT: If Anomen comes asking you about the romance, be honest with
    him! You will be held to what you say. </p>
  <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: Will I miss out on anything if I
    don't play the romance (or vice-versa)? <br />
    <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: Yes, the romancing player will find
    out things about Angelo they wouldn't otherwise. There is no separate “friendship” track—the
    romance has most of the “base” content and more. He still has plenty to say
    to the male or uninterested female <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym>,
    though, and there is a small amount of male-specific content. </p>
  <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: Can I romance Angelo as a male? <br />
    <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: You can attempt to—let's just say Angelo
    has been around the block. When it comes to that, though, he may provide
    certain romantic assets for the heterosexual male <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym>. </p>
  <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: If I don't romance Angelo, will he
    romance another <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>? <br />
    <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: He'll certainly try his damnedest. The
    answer is no, though. </p>
  <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: What language is Angelo speaking
    when he attacks? <br />
    <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: Japanese. I hope it doesn't break the
    mood, but I consider it a translation of his Kara-Turan language, just as
    most of the English is presumably a translation—and Yoshimo does it, too. </p>
  <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: Why is he half Kara-Turan, for that
    matter? </p>
  <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: I don't really know about the names
    in Forgotten Realms, but Dosan sounded Kara-Turan to me (in real life it's
    the name of a Tae Kwon Do form, which would make it Korean). I can only say
    that it seemed right—and is the substance of a lot of jokes. </p>
  <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: Why does Angelo say ‘holla?' Isn't
    that, like, West Coast? <br />
    <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: Hamlet, act 1 scene 1. </p>
  <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: Come to think of it, isn't there
    a lot of Shakespeare in here? <br />
    <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: Everyone has to steal from somewhere;
    I figured it might as well be Shakespeare. It was either that or Evanescence
    lyrics. </p>
  <p>I find it highly probably that Angelo was originally named after a character
    from Shakespeare's <em>Measure For Measure </em>, an unjust magistrate who
    sentences a man to death for impregnating his girlfriend. </p>
  <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: Hey, aren't you that guy...? <br />
    <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: I wrote a long piece of fanfiction (“Fury”)
    in which Angelo was a major character. You can find it on ff.net and on the
    Attic (somewhere) if the mod piques your interest. If you happen to have
    read it, Angelo here is a bit different (since the story doesn't exactly
    follow the game); but he has more in common with that Angelo than with the
    one-dimensional minor villain from the game. </p>
  <p>I also voiced Xan <acronym title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</acronym>/<acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym> and
    co-wrote Xan <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym> with the amazing
    Kulyok (yes, I'm the guy with that annoying, fake British accent). I voice
    Angelo too. There might be a law against voicing your own mod, but don't
    tell anyone. </p>
</div>
<h2>Content</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p> Angelo is a risky <acronym title="Parents Strongly Cautioned - Some Material May Be Inappropriate for Children Under 13">PG-13</acronym> or
    a tame <acronym title="Restricted - Under 17 Requires Accompanying Parent or Adult Guardian">R</acronym>,
    extremely high in suggestion but low in graphica. Your play experience may
    vary. Angelo isn't very respectful of women, and under certain circumstances
    he tells several “disguised” racist jokes that may offend some. There are
    passing homosexual themes. There is also a scene of potential hard drug use,
    if the player allows him/herself to get peer-pressured… </p>
</div>
<h2>Quests</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p><strong>Bounty Hunters </strong></p>
  <p>You don't track them down, they track you down. Now Angelo knows how the
    level 4 <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym> felt back in Baldur's
    Gate. </p>
  <p><strong>When The Last Sword is Sheathed </strong></p>
  <p>Angelo's past is catching up with him in more ways than one. Triggers in
    the government district after the previous quest is finished. If any of you
    my fellow Japanophiles ever wanted your very own yakuza/chanbara/onmyou-do
    interlude in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym>, you need wait no
    longer. This quest can continue into <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym> depending
    on the choices you make. </p>
  <p><strong>The Ballad of Accounting </strong></p>
  <p>Angelo, Imoen, Sarevok and the <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym> will
    have quite a bit to say to each other. Not a quest per se, but it may prove
    interesting. </p>
  <p><strong>The Tactician </strong></p>
  <p>Angelo is, among other things, a former soldier. A few chats with him in <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym> may
    yield experience. </p>
</div>
<h2>Spoiler-Free Simple Walkthrough </h2>
<div class="section">
  <ul>
    <li>Angelo is in the Graveyard District near the northern exit. He will salute
      you, but you have to go up and talk to him. </li>
    <li>You can now find a Kara-Turan cleric of sorts in the Temple District.
      He sells priestly items, including a few unique ones. </li>
    <li>Good katana are hard to come by in the game (especially if, like me,
      you refuse to use the Celestial Fury on principle). Angelo has one proficiency
      dot in a number of other weapons, so if you want to go with one of those
      to bump up to “specialized,” think carefully—you only get about one dot
      to spend in all of <acronym title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</acronym>. </li>
    <li> Angelo's “talk style” is a bit different from other <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym>—he
      isn't used to chatting with his employers, so you're most likely to get
      him talking by talking to him. Later on, when he knows you better, he may
      open up of his own accord. </li>
    <li> In the committed stage of the romance, if you get bored waiting for
      his next talk, you can access player-initiated talks from the dialogue
      option “my love, there's something I'd like to talk to you about…” There
      are a limited number of these, so use sparingly. </li>
    <li>The quests both trigger automatically. If at a certain point you're wondering
      what to do next, and you haven't been to the Windspear Hills yet, you might
      want to pay a visit. </li>
    <li>You can't make any “fatal” mistakes in his quests, although you can do
      plenty of things that are fatal to the player. </li>
    <li>The second quest involves a tough fight. If you do it in chapter 2 or
      3, be prepared. </li>
    <li>There will be conflicts between Angelo and other characters, but nothing
      that <em>has </em> to result in anyone dying or getting kicked out. </li>
    <li>If you go the romance route and also lead on Anomen, at a certain point
      Anomen will confront you. It is important you tell him how you really feel,
      as this talk results in either one or the other romance being broken. </li>
    <li>Angelo will be kidnapped by Bodhi if you romance him. It may not go quite
      as you expect. </li>
    <li>Angelo has a player-initiated comment on every other <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>.
      These will have changed by <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym>,
      so you can get some new ones. </li>
  </ul>

<h2>Spoiler-ish <acronym title="Frequently Asked Questions">FAQ</acronym> </h2>
<div class="section">
  <p><strong>Quests </strong></p>
  <p><em>These should be more or less sequential to keep from spoiling you more
      than you want to be spoiled. </em></p>
  <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: I'm stalled in the Bounty Hunter
    quest. Where is the next guy? <br />
    <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: The second party of bounty hunters should
    ambush you in the Windspear Hills. </p>
  <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: And the next guy? <br />
    <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: The final encounter takes place in the
    Docks. </p>
  <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: Merzer keeps kicking my ass! <br />
    <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: Merzer has high <acronym title="Armor Class">AC</acronym> and
    the fight takes place on the streets of Athkatla, making magic problematic.
    If you've bought your magic license, though, it should be considerably easier. </p>
  <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: What exactly can I do with the lotus
    aside from delivering it? <br />
    <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: Inspector Brega and Renal Bloodscalp
    will both be interested. Both options won't appear yet, though, if you're
    talking to either of them for the first time. Try talking to them again.
    Doing this may have…consequences, however. </p>
  <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: I convinced Pierre to change his
    ways and he gave me the money. What am I supposed to do with this bag of
    lotus now? <br />
    <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: Sawara only cares about the money. You
    can now turn the lotus in to Brega, or sell it Renal, with impunity (in fact
    although it's never stated, I imagine Sawara will admire you for doing this). </p>
  <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: Sawara keeps kicking my ass! Is this
    fight supposed to be impossible? <br />
    <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: Sawara didn't get where he is by being
    a sissy: you're basically fighting the Kara-Turan Aran Linvail. You can beat
    him, but it's not superfluous there is a nonviolent solution. If it's really
    too difficult, try coming back in a later chapter. </p>
  <p>Also, it really helps if you “tip the odds” as Angelo suggests. You've probably
    figured this out, but if not, a simple conversation could be all it takes. </p>
  <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: I don't know what you're talking
    about, I thought he was a cakewalk. <br />
    <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: See, this guy knows how to do it ^_^ </p>
  <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: How do I get the second quest to
    continue into <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym>? <br />
    <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: Part of it will have a continuation
    if you don't return the sword to Ginpachi. Another thread will continue if
    you bribed or charmed Suu. </p>
  <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: Am I supposed to do anything with
    this piece of Sawara's finger? <br />
    <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: Not immediately, hang onto it. If you
    bribed or charmed Suu, it comes into play in <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym>. </p>
  <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: I took Sarevok into my party and
    got a journal entry about his conflict with Angelo. Is this a quest? Can
    I resolve it somehow? <br />
    <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: Yes. If you get Sarevok to change his
    alignment, there will be a last conversation and the “quest” will end. </p>
  <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: Ginpachi keeps kicking my ass! (hey,
    you never know) <br />
    <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: This fight can be tough since you walk
    into it without the chance to buff up—and since you hit it before Amkethran,
    where you can buy items that protect you from backstab. With the right equipment,
    though, it shouldn't be too bad. If you go the romance route, you may have
    gotten an item that will prove useful here. </p>
  <p><strong>Romance </strong></p>
  <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: So, seriously, how do I start the
    romance? <br />
    <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: Angelo won't come looking for it. Flirt,
    then wait. It might be a while at first. </p>
  <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: There aren't any nasty surprises,
    are there? <br />
    <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: Surprises, perhaps; nasty, hopefully
    not ^_^ </p>
  <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: What should I do to keep from breaking
    the romance? <br />
    <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: Humor him. He'll have a lot of questions,
    but in most cases there is no “wrong answer” except not answering. Also at
    one point, he will make a request of you that you can't turn down (without
    losing him). </p>
  <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: What point? Spoil me. <br />
    <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: When he asks you to marry him. There's
    no way to put it off. </p>
  <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: How do I bring Angelo back to life! <br />
    <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: Can you think of anyone who has a connection
    both to Angelo and to the undead? </p>
  <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: No, seriously, who do I talk to? <br />
    <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: Oyaji in the Temple District. </p>
  <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: Why aren't there more flirts!? <br />
    <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: Honestly, I'm not a big fan of descriptive
    text (as opposed to dialogue), but in the name of tradition there are some
    flirts. If you have an idea for one (either just an idea or in your own words)
    I would be happy to consider it, just post it on the forum at <acronym title="The Gibberlings Three">G3</acronym>. </p>

    Sister Vigilante, who has discovered he loves writing readmes; drop him a
      line and he will write you a readme; he will write you a readme for your
      mod you haven't even made yet, no kidding </p>
  <p>with apologies to Shakespeare, Ernest Hemingway, St. Augustine, Charles
    Bukowski, Quentin Tarantino, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Michael Jackson, Pete Doherty,
    Jimmy Buffet, the nation of Japan (as always) and the Blackwater corporation. </p>
  <p>All of the “chants” in the mod are Buddhist chants in Mandarin Chinese.
    I spent a month at a Buddhist temple in Taiwan, and this may be all I got
    out of it, really.</p>

<h2>Easter Eggs (or something like that)</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p> <em>Listed in order of increasing silliness and triviality. </em></p>
  <p>Have you tried: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>In the romance, resting in the inn in Amkethran? </li>
    <li>As a male, cozying up to Suu in <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym>? </li>
    <li>Giving the “Soul of the Deep” to Yoshimo? (he is, after all, Kara-Turan) </li>
    <li>Talking to all those guys in the Government Building who hardly have
      a part in any quest, ever? </li>
    <li>Playing through a certain event in the <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym> romance
      with Haer'Dalis in your party? </li>
    <li>With Anomen? </li>
    <li>Resting at the Seven Veils with Angelo in your party? </li>
    <li>Talking to a priest of Ilmater? </li>
    <li>Talking to the female swindler in the temple district? </li>
    <li>Standing around in a field for twenty minutes to get Angelo's “bored” line? </li>
    <li>Right-clicking on Sakaki a bunch of times? </li>
  </ul>
</div>
<h2>Philosophical Postscript </h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>I hope you play and thoroughly enjoy this mod. If you care to stick around
    a moment, though, and hear an amateur modder's thoughts: </p>
  <p>An idea I had in mind when writing Angelo <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> was
    the difference between banal and radical evil. According to Hannah Arendt,
    a great deal of human wickedness—she had in mind the Nazis—is essentially
    banal in nature. There is surely a lot of truth in this. But if all evil
    is banal, then where do we get the idea of radical evil from—and why is it
    so pervasive and alluring in our stories? </p>
  <p>It's something to think about, I think, </p>
  <p>Love &amp; Peace, <br />
    Sister Vigilante, AKA Incanto </p>

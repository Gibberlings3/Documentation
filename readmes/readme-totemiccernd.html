      <p>Totemic Cernd is a minor modification to Baldur's Gate II (original or Enhanced Editions) that changes Cernd's druid kit from that of a Shapeshifter to a Totemic Druid. In the process, I also decided to increase Cernd's physical statistics somewhat to make him a reasonably attractive alternative to other clerics or druids, such as Jaheira or Anomen.</p>

        Totemic Cernd is packaged
        and installed with WeiDU and
        is distributed as a self-extracting archive. To install, simply double-click
        the archive and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>Alternatively the files can be extracted from the archive using <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/">WinRAR</a>.
        If properly extracted, you should have a totemiccernd folder and setup-totemiccernd.exe
        in your game folder. To install,
        simply double-click setup-totemiccernd.exe and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>Please run setup-totemiccernd.exe in your game folder
        to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>Mac OS X</strong><br />
        <em>If the mod was previously installed, uninstall it before extracting the
        new version. </em>Totemic Cernd   is packaged and installed with WeiDU.
        To install, simply extract the contents of the mod into your game folder.
        If properly extracted, you should have a totemiccernd folder, setup-totemiccernd,
        and setup-totemiccernd.command in your game folder.
        To install, simply double-click setup-totemiccernd.command and
        follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p><strong>Linux</strong><br />
        Download the latest version of WeiDU for
        Linux from <a href="http://www.weidu.org/~thebigg/">weidu.org</a> and extract
        (at least) the WeiDU,
        weinstall and tolower executables in a $PATH directory (E.G. /usr/bin). Following that, open a terminal, cd to your game installation directory, run `tolower' and answer Y to both queries.</p>
      <p> You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini)
        if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save time, the
        archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the first option
        (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only this mod since
        the last time you lower cased file name. If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both
        options is the safe bet.</p>
      <p> After that, run 'weinstall totemiccernd' from your game installation directory
        to install or uninstall the mod. </p>

      <p>Totemic Cernd is a minor modification to Baldur's Gate II that changes Cernd's druid kit from that of a Shapeshifter to a Totemic Druid. In the process, I also decided to increase Cernd's physical statistics somewhat to make him a reasonably attractive alternative to other clerics or druids, such as Jaheira or Anomen.</p>
      <p>Fortunately for me, not one dialog in the entire game mentions the fact that Cernd is a Shapeshifter. So, no in-game dialogues had to be altered, which made this modification a relatively easy one in terms of the amount of files I had to edit.</p>
      <p><strong>Altered Files:</strong></p>
      <p>.CRE</p>
      <ul>
        <li> CERND10.CRE</li>
        <li> CERND12.CRE</li>
        <li> CERND13B.CRE</li>
        <li> CERND14.CRE </li>
      </ul>
      <p>.BCS</p>
      <ul>
        <li> AR1901.BCS</li>
        <li> CEFALD01.BCS</li>
        <li> CUT35I.BCS </li>
      </ul>
      <p>.ITM</p>
      <ul>
        <li> NPSTAF.ITM - Staff of the High Forest</li>
        <li> NPCLCK.ITM - Cloak of the High Forest </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The adjustments to the scripts are primarily to deal with the situation when Cernd is not in the party and challenges Faldorn to ritual combat for the Druid Grove. Faldorn's script causes Cernd to transform into a special werewolf with the MINHIP1.ITM, meaning it is impossible for Cernd to lose the fight. The script changes prevent the transformation from occurring and also gives him the MINHP1.ITM temporarily.</p>

      <p>An increase of 14 attribute points is a large jump, but I believe it can be justified by looking at the attribute totals of the Shapeshifter Werewolf form, WEREWODR.CRE (89) and the Shapeshifter Greater Werewolf form, WEREGR01.CRE (105).</p>

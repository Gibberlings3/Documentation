    <strong> Languages:</strong> English<br />
    <strong> Platforms: </strong>Windows and Mac OS X</p>
</div>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>This mod adds Gavin, an <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> cleric
    of Lathander, to the Baldur's Gate conversions Baldur's Gate Tutu and Baldur's
    Gate Trilogy.</p>
</div>
<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>This mod is designed to work with the Baldur's Gate conversion, <a href="http://www.pocketplane.net/tutu/">Tutu</a>,
    with or without the Tales of the Sword Coast expansion pack, or with <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym>-<acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>.
    This mod should be installed onto Tutu after you have run the conversion
    program, in your Baldur's Gate Tutu directory, or in your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> directory
    for <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym>. Please note that
    for EasyTutu users, this directory is usually named BaldursGateTutu.</p>
  <p>The mod is designed to work with or without the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Project.
    It has been tested with TutuFix v 17 (sans Walking Speeds Fix, although Gavin
    will check for it), Ashes of Embers, <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> Tweaks,
    Divine Remix, Sword Coast Strategems (give that boy a magic weapon, he's
    going to be in for a rough ride), Jastey's Fun with Slime Quest, Sirene's
    Call, Finch, Indira, Mur'Neth, and many other mods. There are no known incompatibilities
    with any mod.</p>
  <p>Please note that as Gavin is not a Bioware <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>,
    he will be unaffected by mods that target Bioware <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym>.
    He will be unaffected by the leveling practices of Sword Coast Strategems,
    although he has his own leveling script. Tutu <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Kitpack
    will have no effect on him whatsoever. Neither <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Project
    nor <acronym title="Sword Coast Strategems">SCS</acronym> will send him to
    wait at an inn, however this feature has already been included as part of
    his kick-out dialogue. Gavin's starting proficiencies are consistent with
    those allowed by his stats using Ashes of Embers.</p>
  <p>Note: The file structure of Gavin v 1.3 is very different from previous
    versions. It is recommended that you uninstall any previous versions prior
    to installing Gavin v 1.3. It will be necessary to start a new game.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>This component adds the new <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Gavin
    to the game. Gavin can be found outside the Song of the Morning Temple, near
    Beregost. Gavin is a cleric of Lathander, and has the following statistics:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><acronym title="Strength">STR</acronym>: 16</li>
    <li><acronym title="Dexterity">DEX</acronym>: 12</li>
    <li><acronym title="Constitution">CON</acronym>: 16</li>
    <li><acronym title="Intelligence">INT</acronym>: 12</li>
    <li><acronym title="Wisdom">WIS</acronym>: 17</li>
    <li><acronym title="Charisma">CHR</acronym>: 12</li>
  </ul>
  <p>His biography is as follows:</p>
  <p>Gavin was born in Ulgoth's Beard, one of the younger children of a sailmaker
    and a midwife. He had an unremarkable childhood, until, at the age of twelve,
    he discovered he had a talent for healing. His father was a follower of Tyr,
    but his mother worshipped Lathander. They were quite surprised to find that
    thier rambunctious son had a calling to the priesthood, but they enthusiastically
    supported his decision, nevertheless, accompanying him to Beregost to begin
    his novitiate. His service to his god and his temple was devout, but otherwise
    unimpressive, and he was ordained a Dawnbringer at the age of nineteen. Since
    then, he has spent most of his time performing varied services for the temple,
    but Gavin's advancement within the ranks has been slow. Gavin is twenty-eight
    when you meet.</p>

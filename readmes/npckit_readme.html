    <p>
      This mod started as a request (by me) in the Cleric Remix workroom for Anomen to be awarded a Priest of
      Helm kit upon passing his knighthood test. Deciding this was outside Remix's remit I quickly spun it
      off into its own mod. Perhaps too quickly. A couple of days later I thought that the mod could be
      bigger and the <acronym title="Non-Player Character"></acronym>NPC Kitpack was born. Designed simply to give those <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> without kits the chance
      improve their lot. Originally I had only planned on giving each <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> one of the original BioWare kits.
      This, however, turned out not to be feasible. This mod will add four new kits and provide the
      opportunity to give a kit to eight of the BioWare <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym>.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Compatibility
    </h2>
    <p>
      This mod is designed to work with Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn with or without the Throne of Bhaal
      expansion pack. Specific mod compatibility has been included for Cleric Remix, Universal Weapons (Ashes
      of Embers), Weapon Styles for All (<acronym title="The Gibberlings Three">G3</acronym> Tweak Pack) and Rogue Rebalancing. The <acronym title="Non-Player Character"></acronym>NPC Kitpack should be
      installed after these mods for full compatibility. The <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Tweak Mod and the Holy Symbols Fix component
      of SimDing0's Tweak Pack are also fully compatible. That is not to say it is not compatible with other
      mods, it will work fine with most other mods, but the changes that are made to kits by any other mods
      won't apply to the kits in the <acronym title="Non-Player Character"></acronym>NPC Kitpack.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Installation
    </h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Windows</strong><br />
       The <acronym title="Non-Player Character"></acronym>NPC Kitpack is packaged and installed with <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>. It is distributed as a self-extracting archive.
      To install, simply double-click the archive and follow the instructions on screen. The kits will take
      immediate effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternatively the files can be extracted from the archive using
      <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/">WinRAR</a>. If properly extracted, you should have a NPCKit folder and
      Setup-NPCKit.exe in your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder. To install, simply double-click Setup-NPCKit.exe and follow the
      instructions on screen. The kits will take immediate effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please run Setup-NPCKit.exe in your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Note for those upgrading from v0.7.1:</em> I have decided to take advantage of a new <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> feature.
      As a result it is necessary for you to uninstall v0.7.1 and then delete NPCKit.tp2 from your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder
      before installing this new version. Sorry for the inconvenience, but this is the best time to make the
      change.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Mac OS X</strong><br />
       <em>If the mod was previously installed, uninstall it before extracting the new version. Please note
      that this mod is incompatible with Mod Organizer.</em> The <acronym title="Non-Player Character"></acronym>NPC Kitpack is packaged and installed with
      <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>. To install, simply extract the contents of the mod into your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder. If properly extracted,
      you should have an NPCKit folder, Setup-NPCKit, and Setup-NPCKit.command in your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder. To
      install, simply double-click Setup-NPCKit.command and follow the instructions on screen. The kits will
      take immediate effect.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Uninstallation
    </h2>
    <p>
      Due to the nature of a lot of the changes made by the <acronym title="Non-Player Character"></acronym>NPC Kitpack uninstalling will not take immediate
      effect. Some effects of the kits are permenant and will remain in the save game. A new game, or a save
      game from before the mod was installed will be required for the effects of the mod to be eradicated.
    </p>
    <h2>

    <p>
      <strong><acronym title="Non-Player Character"></acronym>NPC Kitpack</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a remote possibility that the install could be broken because of the large number of
      components adding kits. To prevent this I have placed all the kits in the same component. As none of
      them are selectable by the <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym> this will not take up any kit slots. If you only installed this component
      you would never know it was there.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Anomen</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Anomen has three components devoted to him, two of which were included in the Kit Anomen mod. The
      components are as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Anomen will gain the Priest of Helm kit on passing his knighthood test.
      </li>
      <li>
        Anomen will gain the Berserker kit on failing his knighthood test.
      </li>
      <li>
        Chaotic Neutral Anomen will not get a Holy Symbol.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Note: Anomen will retain any ranged weapon profiency points (above the one allowed) when he gains his
      berserker kit. He will not be able to gain any more points (again, above the one allowed) once he is a
      Berserker/Cleric.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Edwin</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Edwin is a Red Wizard, but this fact is not mentioned in his kit description. Also, his two extra
      spells per level are not actually explained, although we all <i>know</i> they are granted by his
      amulet. This component will add Red Wizard to Edwin's kit description and give some explanation for
      those two extra spells per level.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      RED WIZARD: When a bard or minstrel wishes to conjure up images of evil magic and darkest sorceries, he
      need only mention the much despised name of the Red Wizards of Thay. Over the centuries, the clever
      masters of this realm have combined powerful magic, espionage, and devious political maneuvering to
      forge a state of virtually unequalled might.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Red Wizards of Thay are called that because of the crimson robes they wear when meeting with others
      of their kind. At other times, donning these flowing, richly embroidered garments is optional. In any
      situation where a Red Wizard is attempting to make an impression or otherwise flaunt his station, he
      will wear such attire. If the wizard is attempting to conceal his identity, of course, he opts for less
      obvious dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Red Wizards must be of an Evil alignment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Advantages:<br />
       - May cast two extra spells per spell level
    </p>
    <p>
      Disadvantages:<br />
       - None
    </p>
    <p>
      CONJURER: The wizard strives to be a master of magical energies, shaping them and casting them as
      spells. To do so, the wizard studies strange tongues and obscure facts and devotes much time to magical
      research. A wizard must rely on knowledge and wit to survive. Only the most powerful are ever seen
      adventuring without a retinue of warriors and other partisans. Because there are different types (or
      schools) of magic, there are different types of wizards. A Conjurer is a wizard that specializes in
      creating useful creatures and objects.
    </p>
    <p>
      School:<br />
       - Conjuration/Summoning
    </p>
    <p>
      Opposition School:<br />
       - Divination
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Red Wizard description adapted from <em>Wizards and Rogues of the Realms</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Imoen and Nalia</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Imoen and Nalia have a new thief kit, Adventurer, available to them. The Adventurer kit provides a
      small bonus to some thieving skills and removes the backstab multiplier. They will also be able to
      select one of the specialist mage kits (excluding Wild Mage), in conjunction with, or separate from,
      the Adventurer kit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: I you choose to give Imoen and Nalia the Adventurer kit <em>and</em> a specialist mage kit then
      the Adventurer kit's description will not show in the 'Kit Description' screen. They will still get all
      the effects and the title bar will show that they do, in fact, have an Adventurer kit.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      ADVENTURER: A jack-of-all-trades, not so much a thief as a character who takes advantage of the general
      thiefly skills on adventures. An Adventurer is preferred by many adventuring parties, because he is
      much less likely than other thieves to betray or steal from his own companions. The successful
      Adventurer knows the value of trust and cooperation, while many a "street thief" has been raised on
      duplicity and (sometimes literal) backstabbing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Advantages:<br />
       - +20% to Open Locks and Find/Remove Traps
    </p>
    <p>
      Disadvantages:<br />
       - No backstab multiplier
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Adventurer kit adapted from the <em>Player's Handbook</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Korgan</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Dwarven Berserkers are know as Battleragers, it even says so in the Berserker kit description. With
      this component Korgan will be a proper Battlerager, instead of a measly Berserker.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      BATTLERAGER: The Battlerager fills a particular niche in dwarf society and culture. He is a fearless
      warrior, able to create an insane rage within himself which increases his fighting ability and distorts
      his physical features. While enraged, a Battlerager's face becomes twisted and his teeth grind
      together. Spittle flies from his mouth and dribbles down his beard. His eyes enlarge, bulge, and become
      bloodshot. Size increases as his muscles swell and his body expands. His fighting ability becomes
      awesome, allowing him to fight longer and harder than any other dwarf. While in his rage, he is almost
      unstoppable. A dangerous enemy, he is a menace to friend and foe alike.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Battlerager may not be of any Lawful alignment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Advantages:<br />
       - May Enrage for 1 turn once per day per 3 levels
    </p>
    <p>
      Disadvantages:<br />
       - Becomes winded after Enraging<br />
       - May not use missile weapons unless they also have a melee component
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Battlerager kit adapted from the <em>Complete Book of Dwarves</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Mazzy</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Mazzy is refered to in the game as a Truesword of Arvoreen, she even has some abilities to complement
      this description. Instead of this psuedo kit I felt she deserved a proper Truesword of Arvoreen kit.
      However, it turns out the Truesword is actually a cleric kit and Mazzy is not a cleric. Taking the
      cleric kit as a base, and being careful not to make the kit as powerful as a paladin, I designed for
      her this new kit:
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      TRUESWORD OF ARVOREEN: Arvoreen is the nearest thing to a halfling war god. He is a god of stern
      defence and aggressive watchfulness, who is always preparing for incursions into halfling lands and
      making ready to repulse hostile creatures at the first sign of trouble. Arvoreen is venerated primarily
      by halfling fighters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fighters that enter the church of Arvoreen, and prove themselves worthy, are risen to the rank of
      Truesword. Trueswords are the protectors and defenders of Halfling communities. They mount regular
      patrols, always investigating the slightest hint of a threat. Many Trueswords regularly adventure to
      gain magical weapons and defensive items of all kinds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trueswords of Arvoreen must be halflings of Lawful Good, Neutral Good, or Lawful Neutral alignment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Advantages:<br />
       - Lay On Hands (heals 1 hit point per level) once per day<br />
       - Detect Evil (as the 1st-level priest spell) once per day<br />
       - From 3rd level can cast Strength (as the 2nd-level wizard spell) once per day<br />
       - From 5th level may Invoke Courage for 1 turn once per day per level<br />
       - From 7th level can cast Glyph of Warding (as the 3rd-level priest spell) once per day<br />
       - From 9th level can cast Strength of One (as the 3rd-level priest spell) once per day<br />
       - From 11th level can cast Haste (as the 3rd level wizard spell, but on themselves only) once per
      day<br />
       - From 14th level can cast Champion's Strength (as the 5th-level priest spell) once per day<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Disadvantages:<br />
       - Can only place more than one proficiency point in short swords, short bows and slings<br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Truesword of Arvoreen kit adapted from <em>Demihuman Deities</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mazzy's <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> script will also be updated to reflect the changes made.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Minsc</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Minsc is from Rashemen, therefore he is a Rashemaar Ranger. This component simply changes Minsc's title
      from Ranger to Rashemaar Ranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Sarevok</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Sarevok's biography mentions that he is a Deathbringer and he comes with the Deathbringer Assault melee
      effect. What is a Deathbringer? I could not find any canon sources for a Deathbringer kit, there is a
      Deathstalker kit in <em>Faiths and Avatars</em>, but a Deathstalker is a speciality priest of Bhaal. I
      didn't feel this fit Sarevok as his goal in (his first) life was to become a god and replace Bhaal.
      Plus Bhaal is dead and Sarevok is a fighter. So this new kit is one of entirely my own design, hope you
      like it.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      DEATHBRINGER: A Deathbinger is not, as the name suggests, a bloodthirsty killer, but a master of the
      fine art of intimidation in combat. Every stance and gesture is designed to maximize their opponent's
      fear and minimize their own. The goal is to so frighten the opponent that they are unable to fight
      back. Eventually it is possible for them to kill with a single blow, not from physical damage but from
      mental.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Deathbringer's first instinct is to cause fear. As a result, it is difficult for Deathbringers not to
      intimidate people and, indeed, determine when not to intimidate people. Their body language outside
      combat makes people pause and worry. However, they can easily recognize and suppress any fear in
      themselves. Their goal is to frighten not be frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Advantages:<br />
       - Immune to fear and morale failure<br />
       - From 6th level can cast Spook (as the 1st level wizard spell) once per day per 5 levels<br />
       - At 11th level gains Deathbringer Assault
    </p>
    <p>
      Disadvantages:<br />
       - -3 penalty to Wisdom and Charisma
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      This component will also fix the long standing bug of Sarevok having an invalid script assignment.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Improved Specialist Mage Descriptions</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      During the course of making this mod I improved the descriptions of the specialist mage kits. I didn't
      do a lot, I simply combined the mage description with the one line of the specialist mage description,
      and added the specialist's school as well as the opposition school. Please see the Conjurer section of
      Edwin's new kit description for an example.

    <strong> Languages:</strong> English, French, German<br /> 
    <strong> Platforms: </strong>Windows, Mac OS X, Linux</p> 
</div> 
<h2>Overview</h2> 
<div class="section"> 
  <p>This mod adds Gavin, an <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> cleric
    of Lathander, to the Baldur's Gate conversions Baldur's Gate Tutu, Baldur's
    Gate Trilogy, and Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition.</p> 
</div> 
<h2>Compatibility</h2> 
<div class="section"> 
  <p>This mod is designed to work with the Baldur's Gate conversion, <a href="http://www.pocketplane.net/tutu/">Tutu</a>,
    with or without the Tales of the Sword Coast expansion pack, with <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym>-<acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>, or 
	<a href="http://forum.baldursgate.com/">BG:EE</a>.
    This mod should be installed onto Tutu after you have run the conversion
    program, in your Baldur's Gate Tutu directory, or in your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> directory
    for <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym>. Please note that
    for EasyTutu users, this directory is usually named BaldursGateTutu.</p> 
  <p>The mod is designed to work with or without the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Project.
    It has been tested with TutuFix v 17 (sans Walking Speeds Fix, although Gavin
    will check for it), Ashes of Embers, <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> Tweaks,
    Divine Remix, Sword Coast Strategems (give that boy a magic weapon, he's
    going to be in for a rough ride), Jastey's Baldur's Gate Mini Quests and Encounters Mod, Sirene's
    Call, Finch, Indira, Mur'Neth, and many other mods. There are no known incompatibilities
    with any mod.</p> 
  <p>Please note that as Gavin is not a Bioware <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>,
    he will be unaffected by mods that target Bioware <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym>.
    He will be unaffected by the leveling practices of Sword Coast Stratagems,
    although he has his own leveling script. Tutu <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Kitpack
    will have no effect on him whatsoever. Neither <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Project
    nor <acronym title="Sword Coast Strategems">SCS</acronym> will send him to
    wait at an inn, however this feature has already been included as part of
    his kick-out dialogue. Gavin's starting proficiencies are consistent with
    those allowed by his stats using Ashes of Embers.</p> 
  <p>Note: The file structure of Gavin version higher than 1.2 is very different from previous
    versions. It is recommended that you uninstall any previous versions prior
    to installing Gavin v 1.3 or higher. It will be necessary to start a new game.</p> 
</div> 
<h2>Installation</h2> 
<div class="section">   
<p><strong>BGII:EE</strong><br />
    If you use BGII Enhanced Edition from GOG or Steam, you need to prepare your game with 
	<a href="https://forums.beamdog.com/discussion/50441/modmerge-merge-your-steam-gog-zip-based-dlc-into-something-weidu-nearinfinity-dltcep-can-use/p1">modmerge</a> before
	installing any mods.
  <p><strong>Windows</strong><br /> 
    Gavin is packaged and installed with <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> and
    is distributed as a self-extracting archive. To install, simply double-click
    the archive and follow the instructions on screen. </p> 
  <p>Alternatively the files can be extracted from the archive using <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/">WinRAR</a>.
    If properly extracted, you should have a Gavin folder and Setup-Gavin.exe
    in your main game folder. To install, simply double-click Setup-Gavin.exe and
    follow the instructions on screen. </p> 
  <p>Please run setup-gavin.exe in your main game folder to reinstall, uninstall or
    otherwise change components. </p> 
  <p><strong>Mac OS X</strong><br /> 
    <em>If the mod was previously installed, uninstall it before extracting the
    new version.</em> Gavin is packaged and installed with <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>.
    To install, simply extract the contents of the mod into your main game folder.
    If properly extracted, you should have a Gavin folder, Setup-gavin, and Setup-gavin.command
    in your main game folder. To install, simply double-click <strong>Setup-gavin.command</strong> and
    follow the instructions on screen.</p> 
	<strong>Linux</strong><br />
Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify. Download the latest version 
of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="http://www.weidu.org/~thebigg "><acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>.org</a> 
and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal, cd to your BG2 installation 
directory, run 'tolower' and answer Y to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) 
if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered, 
so there's no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only 
this mod since the last time you lower cased file name. If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing 
both options is the safe bet.<br />
Run <strong>WeInstall gavin</strong> in your game folder to install the mod. Then run <strong>wine 
BGMain.exe</strong> and start playing.<br />
  Note that this mods assumes that you have oggdec for linux.</p>

<div class="section"> 
  <p>This component adds the new <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Gavin
    to the game. Gavin can be found outside the Song of the Morning Temple, near
    Beregost. Gavin is a cleric of Lathander, and has the following statistics:</p> 
  <ul> 
    <li><acronym title="Strength">STR</acronym>: 16</li> 
    <li><acronym title="Dexterity">DEX</acronym>: 12</li> 
    <li><acronym title="Constitution">CON</acronym>: 16</li> 
    <li><acronym title="Intelligence">INT</acronym>: 12</li> 
    <li><acronym title="Wisdom">WIS</acronym>: 17</li> 
    <li><acronym title="Charisma">CHR</acronym>: 12</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>His biography is as follows:</p> 
  <p>Gavin was born in Ulgoth's Beard, one of the younger children of a sailmaker
    and a midwife. He had an unremarkable childhood, until, at the age of twelve,
    he discovered he had a talent for healing. His father was a follower of Tyr,
    but his mother worshipped Lathander. They were quite surprised to find that
    thier rambunctious son had a calling to the priesthood, but they enthusiastically
    supported his decision, nevertheless, accompanying him to Beregost to begin
    his novitiate. His service to his god and his temple was devout, but otherwise
    unimpressive, and he was ordained a Dawnbringer at the age of nineteen. Since
    then, he has spent most of his time performing varied services for the temple,
    but Gavin's advancement within the ranks has been slow. Gavin is twenty-eight
    when you meet.</p> 
  <p>Quest spoilers:</p> 
  <p>If you can't find the key to unlock the house in Beregost, try looking in the Ulcaster ruins, the Valley of Tombs, and the Bandit Camp.</p>
  <p>Note: Kelddath will only mention the Bassilus quest with Gavin in the group if the PC didn't hear about it, yet. There is no extra reward for the Bassilus quest with Gavin in the party.</p>

      <p>This mod adds Gavin, a neutral good <acronym title="Non-Player Character">Dawnbringer</acronym> of Lathander,  to Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition or the Baldur's Gate conversion projects Tutu, Baldur's      Gate Trilogy, and Enhanced Edition Trilogy. </p>
      <p>Gavin was born in Ulgoth's Beard, one of the younger children of a   sailmaker and a midwife. He had an unremarkable childhood, until, at the   age of 12, he discovered he had a talent for healing. His father was a   follower of Tyr, but his mother worshipped Lathander. They were quite   surprised to find that their rambunctious son had a calling to the   priesthood, but they enthusiastically supported his decision,   nevertheless, accompanying him to Beregost to begin his novitiate. His   service to his god and his temple was devout, but otherwise   unimpressive, and he was ordained a Dawnbringer at the age of 19. Since   then, he has spent most of his time performing varied services for the   temple, but Gavin's advancement within the ranks has been slow. Gavin is   28 when you meet. </p>

    <div class="ribbon_triangle_h2-r"></div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>This mod is designed to work with Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition or the conversion projects EET, BGT, or Tutu. This mod should be installed onto Tutu after you have run the conversion      program, in your Baldur's Gate Tutu directory, or in your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> directory      for <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym>. Please note that      for EasyTutu users, this directory is usually named BaldursGateTutu.</p>
      <p>The mod is designed to work with or without the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Project.      It has been tested with TutuFix v 17 (sans Walking Speeds Fix, although Gavin      will check for it), Ashes of Embers, Tweaks Anthology,      Divine Remix, Sword Coast Stratagems (give that boy a magic weapon, he's      going to be in for a rough ride), Jastey's Baldur's Gate Mini Quests and Encounters Mod, Sirene's      Call, Finch, Indira, Mur'Neth, and many other mods. There are no known incompatibilities      with any mod.</p>
      <p>Please note that as Gavin is not a Bioware <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>,      he will be unaffected by mods that target Bioware <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym>.      He will be unaffected by the leveling practices of Sword Coast Stratagems,      although he has his own leveling script. Tutu <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Kitpack      will have no effect on him whatsoever. Neither <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Project      nor <acronym title="Sword Coast Strategems">SCS</acronym> will send him to      wait at an inn, however this feature has already been included as part of      his kick-out dialogue. Gavin's starting proficiencies are consistent with      those allowed by his stats using Ashes of Embers.</p>
      <p> The Romance Guide is available in PDF in the mod's root folder as RomanceGuide.pdf (or <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/files/file/714-gavin-npc-for-bg/">online</a> here). For modders: an index of variables used in Gavin is also available in the mod's root folder as gavinvariables.html. </p>

      <p> <strong>Special Note for Siege of Dragonspear from Steam/<abbr title="Good Old Games">GOG</abbr></strong><br />
        Good Old Games (<abbr title="Good Old Games">GOG</abbr>) and Steam both package the additional content for Siege of Dragonspear in a method that <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr>, the tool used to install this mod, cannot access. You must run a program called <a href="https://github.com/Argent77/A7-DlcMerger/releases"><abbr title="Downloadable Content">DLC</abbr> Merger</a> on your <abbr title="Siege of Dragonspear">SoD</abbr> installation before you can install this or any other <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr>-based mod. </p>
      <p> <strong>Enhanced Editions Note</strong><br />
        The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game&#39;s folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages. </p>
      <p> <strong>Windows</strong><br />
        The Gavin NPC mod for Windows is distributed as a self-extracting archive and includes a <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr> installer. To install, simply double-click the archive and follow the instructions on screen. </p>
      <p> Alternatively, the files can be extracted into your game directory using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a> or <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-gavin.exe</strong> and the folder <strong>gavin</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-gavin.exe</strong> and follow the instructions on screen. </p>
      <p> You can run <strong>setup-gavin.exe</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components. </p>
      <p> <strong>macOS</strong><br />
        The Gavin NPC mod for macOS is distributed as a compressed tarball and includes a <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr> installer. </p>
      <p> First, extract the files from the tarball into your game directory. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-gavin</strong>, <strong>setup-gavin.command</strong>, and the folder <strong>gavin</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-gavin.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen. </p>
      <p> You can run <strong>setup-gavin.command</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components. </p>
      <p> <strong>Linux</strong><br />
        The Gavin NPC mod for Linux is distributed as a compressed tarball and does not include a <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr> installer. Linux users will need to do a one-time install of <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr> (and a few other adjustments) as described in <a href="https://moebiusproject.gitlab.io/mods_on_linux">this great writeup</a>. </p>
      <p> To install, run &#39;WeInstall gavin in your game folder. </p>
      <p> <strong>Note for Complete Uninstallation</strong><br />
        In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely uninstall the mod using setup-gavin --uninstall at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts. </p>

      <p>The mod has five components.</p>
      <p><strong>Gavin</strong></p>
      <p>This component adds the new <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Gavin      to the game. Gavin can be found outside the Song of the Morning Temple, near      Beregost. Gavin is a NG cleric of Lathander, and has the following statistics:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><acronym title="Strength">STR</acronym>: 16</li>
        <li><acronym title="Dexterity">DEX</acronym>: 12</li>
        <li><acronym title="Constitution">CON</acronym>: 16</li>
        <li><acronym title="Intelligence">INT</acronym>: 12</li>
        <li><acronym title="Wisdom">WIS</acronym>: 17</li>
        <li><acronym title="Charisma">CHR</acronym>: 12</li>
      </ul>
      <p>His biography is as follows:</p>
      <p class="kit_description">Gavin was born in Ulgoth's Beard, one of the younger children of a sailmaker      and a midwife. He had an unremarkable childhood, until, at the age of twelve,      he discovered he had a talent for healing. His father was a follower of Tyr,      but his mother worshipped Lathander. They were quite surprised to find that      thier rambunctious son had a calling to the priesthood, but they enthusiastically      supported his decision, nevertheless, accompanying him to Beregost to begin      his novitiate. His service to his god and his temple was devout, but otherwise      unimpressive, and he was ordained a Dawnbringer at the age of nineteen. Since      then, he has spent most of his time performing varied services for the temple,      but Gavin's advancement within the ranks has been slow. Gavin is twenty-eight      when you meet.</p>
      <p> Gavin will attempt to befriend a protagonist of any race who is not   evil or an assassin. Gavin will not withhold his friendship based on   reputation, but he will leave if it should fall below 5. There are no   statistical requirements for friendship. </p>
      <p> Gavin will join a party with an evil or assassin protagonist, and will make interjections and banter with other <acronym title="Non-Player Characters"><abbr title="Non-Player Characters"><abbr title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</abbr></abbr></acronym>, but he will not participate in any of the friendship talks. </p>
      <p><em>Quest spoilers:</em></p>
      <p>If you can't find the key to unlock the house in Beregost, try   looking in the Ulcaster ruins, the Valley of Tombs, and the Bandit Camp.</p>
      <p>Note: Kelddath will only mention the Bassilus quest with Gavin in   the group if the PC didn't hear about it, yet. There is no extra reward   for the Bassilus quest with Gavin in the party.</p>
      <p><strong>Gavin Romance (Mature Content)</strong></p>
      <p> Gavin has no racial preferences, for friendship or romance. A <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/files/file/714-gavin-npc-mod-for-bg1-tutu-bgt-bgee-or-eet/" rel="">romance guide</a> (<acronym title="Portable Document Format">PDF</acronym>, 916k) is available (there's also a copy in the mod folder). </p>
      <ul>
        <li> <strong>Gender:</strong> Gavin will only romance a female protagonist. </li>
        <li> <strong>Alignment:</strong> While Gavin will befriend a neutral protagonist, he will only be attracted to a female of good alignment. </li>
        <li> <strong>Class restrictions:</strong> Gavin will not be attracted to an assassin, bounty hunter, or necromancer of any alignment. </li>
        <li> <strong>Stat requirement:</strong> Gavin admires a strong leader, so   he will only be attracted to a protagonist with a charisma of 12 or   better and a wisdom of 10 or better. </li>
        <li> <strong>Reputation:</strong> A reputation of 11 or higher is required   to initiate and sustain the romance, but for it to progress past a   certain rather obvious point, a reputation of 15 or better is required   and must be maintained. Gavin will warn the <acronym title="Player Character"><abbr title="Player Character">PC</abbr></acronym> if her reputation needs work with plenty of time to improve it. </li>
        <li> <strong>Offense:</strong> Gavin is not particularly easily offended,   but he will not tolerate frequent insult to his values, or too many   callous or cruel decisions. Gavin appreciates the kind of maturity that   cannot be measured in years. Obviously immature <acronym title="Player Character"><abbr title="Player Character">PC</abbr></acronym> responses are also likely to offend. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>This component will install a romance track for Gavin. The player can select the default time between Gavin's romance banters. Options are 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 1 hour (default), 1 hour 15 minutes, and 1 hour 30 minutes. </p>
      <p><strong>Gavin Flirt Pack</strong></p>
      <p>If the player installs Gavin's romance track, they can also install a flirt pack for Gavin. From time to time Gavin will flirt with the PC. </p>
      <p><strong>Alternative Portraits</strong></p>
      <p>Gavin has <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/gallery/album/44-gavin-alternative-portraits/">six alternative portraits</a> that the player can select. </p>
      <p><strong>Gavin Player-Initiated Dialogues</strong></p>
      <p>This will add the ability for the player to approach Gavin and begin banters with him, just as they can with other NPCs. </p>

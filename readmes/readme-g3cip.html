      <p> For aspiring modders, one of the things I always recommend as a first   project is an item pack. It gives you a little bit of experience making   items, creatures, stores, and some basic scripting and dialogue. As part   of the <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/topic/38732-2024-baldur%E2%80%99s-gate-community-creative-craziness-challenge/" rel="">Baldur&rsquo;s Gate Community Creative Craziness Challenge</a>, I did just this.  As a tutorial live stream and collaborative project, creating items submitted by you. </p>
      <p> Welcome to the <strong><abbr title="The Gibberlings Three">G3</abbr> Community Item Pack</strong>,  a <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr> compilation of items submitted by players, and created (for the most part) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUfT9RwXqik&amp;list=PL_6isJ-LYE-RJiKBf3VbwAQkRdBo8C6FA">live on stream</a> to showcase how to make Infinity Engine mods. The items are intended for Baldur's Gate II, original or Enhanced Edition. You can view the mod being created with this playlist, including the very typing of this sentence. </p>

      <p> This mod works on Baldur's Gate II, either original or Enhanced Edition, and their respective conversion projects, BGT and EET. There are no known incompatibilities. Note that some items require EE functionality and are not available on the originals. In terms of install order, this mod should be installed early in the mod process. </p>

      <p> First time installing a mod? Check out <abbr title="The Gibberlings Three">G3</abbr>&#39;s comprehensive tutorial: <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/topic/33164-a-new-player%E2%80%99s-guide-to-installing-and-playing-mods/">A New Player's Guide to Installing and Playing Mods</a>. </p>
      <p> <strong>Enhanced Editions Note</strong><br />
        The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game&#39;s folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages. </p>
      <p> <strong>Windows</strong><br />
        G3 Community Item Pack for Windows is distributed as a self-extracting archive and includes a <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr> installer. To install, simply double-click the archive and follow the instructions on screen. </p>
      <p> Alternatively, the files can be extracted into your game directory using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a> or <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-g3cip.exe</strong> and the folder <strong>g3cip</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-g3cip.exe</strong> and follow the instructions on screen. </p>
      <p> You can run <strong>setup-g3cip.exe</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components. </p>
      <p> <strong>macOS</strong><br />
        G3 Community Item Pack for macOS is distributed as a compressed tarball and includes a <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr> installer. </p>
      <p> First, extract the files from the tarball into your game directory. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-g3cip</strong>, <strong>setup-g3cip.command</strong>, and the folder <strong>g3cip</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-g3cip.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen. </p>
      <p> You can run <strong>setup-g3cip.command</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components. </p>
      <p> <strong>Linux</strong><br />
        G3 Community Item Pack for Linux is distributed as a compressed tarball and does not include a <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr> installer. Linux users will need to do a one-time install of <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr> (and a few other adjustments) as described in <a href="https://moebiusproject.gitlab.io/mods_on_linux">this great writeup</a>. </p>
      <p> To install, run &#39;WeInstall g3cip in your game folder. </p>
      <p> <strong>Note for Complete Uninstallation</strong><br />
        In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely uninstall the mod using setup-g3cip --uninstall at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts. </p>

      <p> The G3 Community Item Pack has one component with two small variations. Multiple items in the mod can cast arcane spells; you can choose to have the items behave like scrolls in that they will summon the Cowled Wizards if used in Athkatla. In the second option, these items will not summon the Cowled Wizards. Note that when using the second option, other mods that change the behaviors of these spells may not necessarily be reflected in the spells when cast by these items. Most items are sold by a merchant, Gilbert Lington the Third, in Trademeet. A handful have been placed around the game for you to find. The following items have been added (items in italics are EE-only):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Dart of the Severing Mist</li>

      <p> This mod was inspired by the <strong><abbr title="Baldur's Gate"><a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/topic/38732-2024-baldur&rsquo;s-gate-community-creative-craziness-challenge/#comment-342226">BG</a></abbr><a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/topic/38732-2024-baldur%E2%80%99s-gate-community-creative-craziness-challenge/#comment-342226"> Community Creative Craziness Challenge</a></strong>, an event designed to get folks active in creating art, writings, and mods. This was spun up into a video tutorial series by CamDawg, creating item ideas submitted by players. </p>
      <p>In particular, two folks need to be recognized: jmerry was volunteered, at short notice, to make a first pass at submitted items to make sure they were feasible and appropriate. Thanks!</p>
      <p>Second, the majority of the artwork for this mod was provided by zenblack, and the art is outstanding. So a second big thank you to ZB!</p>
      <p>Thanks also go to everyone who submitted ideas that were turned into items: WanderingScholar, GlitterGear, Mithradates, lynx, subtledoctor, ThacoBell, suy, cdx,  DiesIrae, jmerry, CrevsDaak, Giovanski, Prof Errata, a.greene, Marzx13, StummvonBordwehr, and Brutalitops. Thanks also to all of the submissions that didn't make it; I will be revisiting the project and adding more items in the future. </p>
      <p>Thanks to everyone who joined us on the live stream, I very much appreciate that I wasn't just talking to myself for hours. </p>

      <p> The modding community for the Infinity Engine has been going strong for more than 20 years now, and is the culmination of thousands of unpaid modding hours by fellow fans of the game. Modders produce their best work and players get the best, well-supported mods when we all work together. </p>
      <p> There are two big ways to upset this harmony. One is to claim someone else&#39;s work as your own. The second is to host and redistribute a mod without permission from the author(s). </p>
      <p> Be kind to your fellow players and modders. Don&#39;t do either. </p>

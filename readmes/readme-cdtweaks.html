      <p>The Tweaks Anthology is a WeiDU compilation
        of fixes, cosmetic changes, and tweaks. Some of these were fan requests,
        others are needed fixes, and others simply make dealing with the more irritating
        aspects of the game engine easier. Each component can be installed separately
        so the player can pick and choose only which ones they wish to install. </p>

      <p>This mod includes and deprecates a slew of other mods: the BG2 Tweak Pack, the G3 Tweak
        Pack, the Tutu Tweak Pack,  Wes Weimer's Ease of Use, the Icewind Dale Tweak Pack, the Icewind Dale II Tweak Pack, the Baldur's Gate Tweak Pack, and the Planescape: Torment Tweak Pack. </p>
      <p>This mod works on all Infinity Engine games. This includes</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The series of Enhanced Editions published by Beamdog, which at present includes Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition (BGEE), Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition (BG2EE),  Icewind Dale: Enhanced Edition (IWDEE), and Planescape: Torment: Enhanced Edition (PsTEE). The BGEE Siege of Dragonspear expansion (SoD) is supported as well. All of the Enhanced Edition games include the original expansion packs, e.g. IWDEE includes Heart of Winter and Trials of the Luremaster. </li>
        <li>The original Baldur's Gate (BG), with or without the Tales of the Sword Coast (TotSC) expansion</li>
        <li>The original Baldur's Gate II (BG2 or just SoA), with or without the Throne of Bhaal (ToB) expansion</li>
        <li>The conversion projects Baldur's Gate Trilogy (BGT), Baldur's Gate Tutu (Tutu), Icewind Dale-in-Baldur's Gate II (IWD-in-BG2), and Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET)</li>
        <li>The original Icewind Dale (IWD) with or without either of its expansions, Heart of Winter (HoW) and Trials of the Luremaster (TotLM)</li>
        <li>Icewind Dale II (IWD2)</li>
        <li>Planescape: Torment (PsT)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>While the mod works on all of these platforms, not every component is available for every game; check the individual components for details using the acronyms listed above. Every component in this mod makes interactive
        changes and should, in general, be compatible with other mods. Except where
        noted, the tweaks adjust items or dialogues added by other mods. As such,
        it is highly recommended that you install this mod last if you wish to take
        full advantage of it. For example, installing a mod that adds weapons after
        you install Alter Weapon Proficiency System from Tweaks will mean that the
        mod's weapons may not use the new system. </p>
      <ul>
        <li> The Can't Kill Romance option of Romance Cheats should be used with
          caution with third-party NPC romance
          mods. </li>
        <li>Multiple Strongholds (either variant) may not work correctly with Oversight's
          Cleric Kits component</li>
        <li>The changes to Cromwell's dialogue in the Allow Cromwell to Upgrade Watcher's
          Keep Items component should play nicely with other mods, provided the other
          mods don't mangle his dialogue (older versions of Item Upgrade, for example) </li>
        <li>Certain mod items may not be affected by the item tweaks--in some cases,
          the tweak can't be made on the fly, so items to be modified are kept
          on static lists rather than a list made at installation time. If you find
          items not being modified by a certain tweak please report it to the <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/?showforum=34">Tweak
          Packs forum</a>. </li>

      <p><strong>Special Note for Siege of Dragonspear from Steam/GOG<br />
        </strong>Good Old Games (GOG) and Steam both package the additional content for Siege of Dragonspear in a method that WeiDU, the tool used to install this mod, cannot access. You must  run a program called <a href="https://forums.beamdog.com/discussion/50441/modmerge-merge-your-steam-gog-zip-based-dlc-into-something-weidu-nearinfinity-dltcep-can-use/p1">Modmerge</a> on your SoD installation  before you can install this or any other WeiDU-based mod. </p>
      <p><strong>Unattended Installation</strong><br />
        A new configuration file, cdtweaks.txt, is now available in the mod's folder. Players can use this file to set inputs for the <strong>Romance Cheats</strong> and <strong>Minimum Stats Cheat</strong> components prior to installation. Doing so will allow the mod to be installed unattended, e.g. as part of a Big World Setup install. If the configuration file is not utilized, or indicates no changes, the player will be prompted during installation of these components, just like before. </p>
      <p><strong>Enhanced Editions Note</strong><br />
        The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every   patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a   modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as   even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with   your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a   new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. For BG:EE it is important that you install the mod to the language   version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod   will not show but give error messages. </p>
      <p><strong>Windows</strong><br />
        Tweaks Anthology for Windows is distributed as a self-extracting   archive and includes a WeiDU installer. To install, simply double-click   the archive and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, the files can be extracted into your game directory using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a> or <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-cdtweaks.exe</strong> and the folder <strong>cdtweaks</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-cdtweaks.exe</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-cdtweaks.exe</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>Mac OS X</strong><br />
        The Tweaks Anthology for Mac OS X is distributed as a compressed tarball and includes a WeiDU installer.</p>
      <p>First, extract the files from the tarball into your game directory. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-cdtweaks</strong>, <strong>setup-cdtweaks.command</strong>, and the folder <strong>cdtweaks</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-cdtweaks.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-cdtweaks.command</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>Linux</strong><br />
        The Tweaks Anthology for Linux is distributed as a compressed tarball and does not include a WeiDU installer.</p>
      <p>Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.</p>
      <p>Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="http://www.weidu.org/%7Ethebigg/">WeiDU.org</a> and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal, cd to your game installation directory, run tolower   and answer Y to both queries. You can avoid running the second option   (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save   time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the   first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only   this mod since the last time you lowercased file names. If you're   unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.</p>
      <p>To install, run WeInstall cdtweaks in your game folder. Then run wine BGMain.exe and start playing. </p>
      <p><strong> Note for Complete Uninstallation</strong><br />
        In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely uninstall the mod using setup-cdtweaks --uninstall at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts. . </p>

      <p>The Tweaks Anthology has many
        components, which can be installed completely independently of one another.
        For convenience, they are grouped into five broad categories. At installation
        time, players can select or ignore entire categories to streamline the installation
        process.</p>
      <p>Italics running underneath each component indicate availability for various games. Unless specified, a component will work on a game with or without its expansions unless noted, e.g. a component labeled <em>BG2</em> would work on Baldur's Gate II with or without the Throne of Bhaal expansion. If the expansion is required or forbidden, the note will either be <em>BG2 (requires ToB)</em> or <em>BG2 (without ToB)</em> respectively. Components that are not available for your game will be skipped automatically by the installer. </p>

    </div>
    <div class="ribbon_triangle_h3-l"></div>
    <div class="ribbon_triangle_h3-r"></div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>This batch of tweaks generally changes the look and feel of the game, without
        making general rule changes or altering the underlying mechanics of the engine. </p>
      <p><strong>Remove Helmet Animations</strong><br />
        <em>All games except PsT, PsTEE</em></p>
      <p>Many don't like how any of the helmets look on the character avatars. Now
        they can't be seen at all - just like ioun stones. This component will
        affect <em>all</em> helmets in the game, including helmets introduced by
        mods.</p>
      <p><strong>Imoen Avatar Change</strong><br />
        <em>BG2EE, EET, BG2, BGT</em></p>
      <p> This component will change Imoen's avatar from a thief to a mage.</p>
      <p><strong>Nalia Avatar Change</strong><br />
        <em>BG2EE, EET, BG2, BGT</em></p>
      <p> This component will change Nalia's avatar from a mage to a thief.</p>
      <p><strong>Viconia Skin Color Change</strong><br />
        <em>BGEE, BG2EE, EET, BG, BG2, Tutu, BGT</em></p>
      <p> A fan request, this component will change Viconia's in-game avatar to have
        dark blue skin to match her default portrait.</p>
      <p><strong>Avatar Morphing Script</strong><br />
        <em>BGEE, BG2EE, EET,  BG2, Tutu, BGT, IWD-in-BG2</em></p>
      <p> This script allows you to select whatever PC avatar
        you wish for your character or any joinable NPC.
        Assign this script to the character whose avatar you wish to change. To change
        the avatar return to the game screen, ensure the party AI in
        on (and the game is not paused) and press 'S'. This will take you to the
        avatar selection screen. Once the morph is complete re-assign a combat script
        to the character. Please note that this component can cause slowdowns on
        older systems. </p>
      <p><strong>Weapon Animation Tweaks</strong><br />
        <em>All games</em></p>
      <p> By default, spears in BG2 use
        33% overhead swings, 33% backhand swings and only 34% thrusting attacks.
        Wouldn't it make more sense to use the pointy end?</p>
      <p>This component adjusts the attack animation balances of various weapons
        classes: spears, staves, short swords, and one-handed blunt instruments such
        as clubs and maces. Spears and short swords now primarily use thrusting attacks
        and staves are more consistent as a class and use more swinging attacks.
        A handful of clubs and maces were using thrust attacks; they now only use
        swinging attacks like all other one-handed blunt weapons. This component
        also changes morningstars to use a mace animation when attacking, instead
        of the flail-like ball-and-chain animation. Morningstars are depicted in
        inventory icons and description pictures as being closer to spiked maces.
        This component will affect <em>all</em> items in the game, including items
        introduced by mods. </p>
      <p><strong>Icewind Dale Casting Graphics </strong><br />
        <em>BGEE, BG2EE, EET,  BG2, BGT, Tutu, IWD-in-BG2</em> </p>
      <p>When your character casts a spell, you get a pretty sequence of colors swirling
        around their hand depending on the school the spell cast came from. A necromantic
        spell, for example, looks quite different from creating an illusion. The
        Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale games use different sets of animations for
        the schools. This component changes the spellcasting animations to those
        of Icewind Dale. Note that this is purely a cosmetic change--the spells
        themselves function exactly as before. Screenshots for comparison are available
        in the <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/gallery/album/27-tweaks-anthology/">Tweaks
        gallery</a>. </p>
      <p><strong>Baldur's Gate  Casting Graphics </strong><br />
        <em>IWDEE, IWD, IWD2</em></p>
      <p>This is the inverse of the previous component for the Icewind Dale series of games. Screenshots for comparison are available
        in the <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/gallery/album/27-tweaks-anthology/">Tweaks
        gallery</a>. </p>
      <p><strong>Restore SoA Load Screen
        Logo</strong><br />
        <em>BG2 (requires ToB)</em></p>
      <p> This component will change the logo on the load screen from the ToB logo (the symbol of Bhaal) to the original Shadows of Amn logo (elves in opposition). This component will not work if you have
        biffed your override folder, a common practice for many large mods. Screenshots
        for comparison are available in the <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/gallery/image/487-restore-soa-load-screen-logo/">Tweaks
        gallery</a>. </p>
      <p><strong>Restore IWD Loading Screens (icelus) </strong><br />
        <em>IWD (requires HoW)</em></p>
      <p> This component will change the logo on the load screen from the HoW logo (a white dragon) to the original IWD logo (Kuldahar's tree). Screenshots
        for comparison are available in the <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/gallery/image/505-restore-iwd-loading-screens-icelus/">Tweaks
        gallery</a>. </p>
      <p><strong>Disable Portrait Icons Added by Equipped Items</strong><br />
        <em>All games</em></p>
      <p> This component will prevent items from displaying the small icons (fire resistance,
        protection from charm) that appear on the character portrait while equipped.
        This will not affect the actual effects of the items, only the display
        of the icon. It will also not affect icons added by spells or other means. </p>
      <p><strong>Commoners Use Drab Colors</strong><br />
        <em>BGEE, BG2EE,  EET,  BG2, BGT, Tutu</em></p>
      <p> Unlike Icewind Dale, commoners in the Baldur's Gate series wear
        brightly colored clothes. This tweak changes the random selections of colors
        for commoners to a drab palette. The dress of noblemen and noblewomen are
        not affected. </p>
      <p><strong>Icon Improvements </strong><br />
        <em>All games except IWD2, PsT, PsTEE</em></p>
      <p> This component uses a combination of BG, IWD,
        and BG2 icons to better differentiate
        armor when it is on the ground. It also restores the inventory icon to the
        Case(s) of Plenty. Screenshots for comparison are available in the <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/gallery/album/27-tweaks-anthology/">Tweaks
        gallery</a>. </p>
      <p><strong>Force All Dialogue to Pause</strong><br />
        <em>All games</em></p>
      <p> This component will change all dialogue to pausing. No longer will bandits
        attack in the middle of a conversation. This component will affect <em>all</em> dialogues
        in the game, including ones introduced by mods. </p>
      <p><strong>Fix Boo's Squeak</strong><br />
        <em>BGEE, BG2EE,  EET, BG, BG2,    BGT, Tutu</em></p>
      <p> When you click on Boo in Minsc's inventory you're treated to a terrible, sped-up sound of someone saying 'squeak'. This component replaces this awful noise with an actual Boo squeak pared from one of Minsc's sound files. </p>
      <p><strong>Make Magic Shields Glow (plainab/grogerson)</strong><br />
        <em>All games except PsT, PsTEE</em></p>
      <p> For those who don't like that magic shields either mimic the primary color of the wielder or      are a dull wood brown, this little component changes the magic shields so their panels      now glow with their protective enchantments. </p>
      <p><strong>Unique Icons</strong><br />
        <em>BG2EE, IWDEE, EET, BG2, BGT, IWD, IWD-in-BG2</em></p>
      <p>Icewind Dale, and to a lesser extent BG2, has a frustrating habit of using the same icon for multiple items, making them difficult to tell apart from one another. This component gives unique      icons to about 200 items in Icewind Dale and about 80 in Baldur's Gate II. For example, the dozen or so items that all used      the icon for the Ring of Protection +1 in Icewind Dale now use unique icons. The 'new' icons      have been scavenged from other Infinity Engine games. A <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/gallery/image/486-unique-icons/">before and after image</a> is available in the Tweaks gallery. </p>
      <p><strong>Unique Containers (Miloch)<br />
        </strong> <em>BGEE, BG2EE, IWDEE, EET, BG2, BGT, Tutu, IWD, IWD-in-BG2</em></p>
      <p>Originally a standalone mini-mod from Miloch, this mod has been incorporated into Tweaks. There are three options--fixes only, unique containers, or unique containers and names. You can see <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/gallery/image/504-unique-containers-miloch/">example icons</a> in the Tweaks gallery. From the original readme:</p>
      <div class="quote">
        <p> &quot;This mini-mod assigns unique icons to all containers in the game.              Containers include standard and mod-added bags of holding, gem bags,              scroll cases, potion cases and ammo belts. The tweak allows you to              identify containers at a glance by color and use them for a              particular type of storage. Or it just makes your character's              accessories color-coordinated.  Optionally, you can assign unique              names (based on the color) to the containers to differentiate them              further. </p>
        <p> &quot;The mod will also fix various issues with stores and containers in              both the unmodded (and Fixpacked) games, as well as with mods. Some              of those mods include <acronym title="Big Picture">BP</acronym>, <acronym title="Check the Bodies">CtB</acronym>, <acronym title="Never-Ending Journey Second Edition">NEJ2</acronym>, <acronym title="Region of Terror">RoT</acronym>, <acronym title="Shadows Over Soubar">SOS</acronym> and <acronym title="Unfinished Business">UB</acronym>. Most              significantly, it fixes some issues with Lost Items              v2, including containers with duplicate stores attached and              other mod usability issues pointed out by Bursk and SixOfSpades.              You don't need to have any of these mods installed to use the main              feature though.&quot;</p>
      </div>
      <p><em>Note:</em> While the mod has been expanded to cover IWD/IWDEE/IWD-in-BG2,  it will use BG2-style container icons instead of IWD-style ones.</p>
      <p><strong>Use Character Colors Instead of Item Colors</strong><br />
        <em>All games except PsT, PsTEE</em></p>
      <p>In the original Baldur's Gate, shields and helmets generally took on the major/minor colors of the character wearing them. In Baldur's Gate II, most shields and helmets instead set fixed colors so that the paperdoll and game screen would always match the item icons. You can <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/gallery/image/503-use-character-colors-instead-of-item-colors/">see a comparison</a> in the Tweaks gallery. This component allows you to use the BG behavior to allow helmets and shields to use character colors. The component allows you to select changing shield, helmets or both; and for choosing to alter all or just non-magical ones. </p>
      <p><strong>Remove Blur Effect from Equipped Items</strong></p>
      <p>This component will remove the blur effect from items such as the Cloak of Displacement and The Claw of Kazgaroth. This will not interfere with items that provide blur effects for creatures such as ghosts or from limited blur effects from spells or limited-use items. </p>
      <p><strong>Separate Resist Fire/Cold Portrait Icon into Separate Icons (Angel)</strong><br />
        <em>All games except PsT, PsTEE</em></p>
      <p>This component will replace any instance of spells or items that use the Resist Fire/Cold portrait icon with separate Protection from Cold and/or Protection from Fire icons, as appropriate. </p>

      <p><strong>More Interjections</strong><br />
        <em>BGEE, BG2EE, IWDEE, EET,  BG2,    BGT, Tutu, IWD-in-BG2</em></p>
      <p> One of the more common triggers for dialogue interjections does not quite
        work as well as intended--Irenicus not realizing Yoshimo is in your party
        at Spellhold is a common example in Baldur's Gate II. This component will interactively replace
        these faulty triggers with a simple in-party check, similar to the Valen
        or Solaufein mods. The net result is that some characters may be chiming
        in on conversations from half-a-map away, but it also means no more silliness
        such as Irenicus missing Yoshimo when he's standing four feet away. If party
        members are in another area, this component could cause some dialogues to
        exit early. This component will affect <em>all</em> dialogues and scripts
        in the game, including ones introduced by mods that use the IsValidForPartyDialogue
        trigger, provided this component is installed after them. </p>
      <p><strong>Alter HP Triggers for NPC Wounded
        Dialogues</strong><br />
        <em> BG2EE,  EET,  BG2, BGT</em></p>
      <p> Many NPCs have banters for
        when they are wounded. However, the triggers are typically for HP levels
        so low that many players never see them. This component will raise the HP trigger
        level so that the player has a better chance of seeing these dialogues.</p>
      <p><strong>Reveal Wilderness Areas Before Chapter Six</strong><br />
        <em>BG2EE,  EET,  BG2, BGT</em></p>
      <p> This component will allow you to travel to the three wilderness areas from
        the City Gates area at any point in the game. Previously, the Small Teeth
        Pass, North Forest, and Forest of Tethyr areas were not available until chapter
        six. Please note that while not incompatible per se, this may cause conflicts
        with mods that set encounters in these areas that assume you've completed
        the story through chapter six. </p>
      <p><strong>Make Cloakwood Areas Available Before Completing the Bandit Camp </strong><br />
        <em>BGEE,   EET, BG,     BGT, Tutu</em> </p>
      <p> This component will allow you to travel to the Cloakwood forest from a nearby
        area prior to completing the Bandit Camp. This will allow you to explore,
        complete Cloakwood quests, and pick up Cloakwood NPCs earlier
        in the game. The component has two options: open up the first area only (with
        the lodge and Aldeth Sashenstar) or open up all four wilderness areas, leaving
        just the mines themselves inaccessible until after the Bandit Camp. </p>
      <p>This functionality is also available from the BG1 NPC Project.</p>
      <p><strong>Improved Athkatlan City Guard</strong><br />
        <em> BG2EE,  EET,  BG2, BGT</em></p>
      <p> The Amnish guards aren't really tough enough to keep the peace in the cities,
        what with all the thieves and vampires around. This component makes the various
        Amnish guards and the like slightly tougher, and gives them a chance of summoning
        backup in the form of either another guard, a Sanctioned Wizard or a Militia
        Cleric.</p>
      <p>Please note that the guards aren't amazing killing machines, and this isn't
        aiming to make the game a hardcore battle experience. You won't get much XP or
        loot for randomly going around killing soldiers, either. But it might make
        such activities a little more interesting.</p>
      <p><strong>Gradual Drow Item Disintegration </strong> <br />
        <em>BG2EE,  EET,  BG2, BGT</em></p>
      <p>Rather than your drow items turning to dust immediately upon exiting the
        Underdark, they will gradually degrade over time. They also have a chance
        to break every time they are used in combat. Please note that this component
        adds a number of item checks to the main game script; as such it can cause
        slowdowns when you have a very large number of items in your inventory and
        bags of holding. </p>
      <p><strong>Breakable Nonmagical Armor, Helms, and Shields<br />
        </strong><em>BGEE, EET, Tutu</em></p>
      <p> The iron crisis in the Sword Coast means that nonmagical iron weapons can
        break when used in combat. This component will extend the same vulnerability
        to nonmagical iron armor, helmets, and shields to close an oversight by the
        game. </p>
      <p>This tweak is not available for Baldur's Gate Trilogy as it contains this
        functionality by default.</p>
      <p><strong>Improved Multi-Player Kick-out Dialogues</strong><br />
        <em>BGEE, BG2EE, IWDEE, EET, BG (requires TotSC), BG2,    BGT, Tutu, IWD-in-BG2 </em></p>
      <p> This allows you to ask multi-player created NPCs to &quot;wait
        here&quot; or go to a nearby meeting place. For BG2EE/EET/BG2/BGT, options are added to send NPCs to the Copper Coronet or the Pocket Plane. For BGEE/EET/BG/Tutu, options are added to send NPCs to the Friendly Arms Inn, Jovial Juggler in Beregost, the Temple of Helm in Nashkel, or the Elfsong in Baldur's Gate. For IWDEE/IWD-in-BG2, options are added for the Winter's Cradle Tavern in Easthaven, the Root Cellar in Kuldahar, or the Whistling Gallows in Lonelywood. </p>
      <p><strong>BG NPCs go to inns (DavidW/Zed Nocear)</strong><br />
      <em>BGEE, EET, BG (requires TotSC), BGT, Tutu</em></p>
      <p><em>&quot;One of the nice features of BG2 is      the ability to ask NPCs to      meet you somewhere else, rather than just getting them to stand around forlornly.      This component introduces this feature for the &quot;core&quot; BG NPCs. You can send them to the Friendly      Arm Inn, the Elfsong Tavern in Baldur's Gate (from chapter 5), the Nashkel      Inn (if you've been to Nashkel), or the Jovial Juggler in Beregost (if you've      been to Beregost). You can't send them there from Balduran's Isle, the Ice      Island, the Candlekeep dungeons, or the lower levels of Durlag's Tower.</em></p>
      <p><em>&quot;To send someone to an inn, first kick them out of the party. Then talk to      them - you should be given the opportunity to ask them to go to an inn and      await you there.&quot; </em></p>
      <p><strong>Add Bags of Holding</strong><br />
        <em>BGEE, BG2EE,  EET,  BG2, IWD (requires Heart of Winter),   BGT, Tutu, IWD-in-BG2</em></p>
      <p> For Baldur's Gate content, this component will add a gem bag to the Friendly Arm Inn store, a scroll
        case at the High Hedge, an ammo belt to Thunderhammer Smithy, a potion case
        to the Nashkel General Store, and a bag of holding at the Sorcerous Sundries
        in Baldur's Gate.</p>
      <p>For Baldur's Gate II content, this component adds potion cases
        to the stores of Roger the Fence and Mrs. Cragmoon and ammo belts to the
        stores of the Trademeet blacksmith and Perter. </p>
      <p>For Icewind Dale content,       Heart of Winter added support for bags of holding, and scattered a few scroll      cases and gem bags about the game. Trials of the Luremaster added bags of      holding, but only to its new areas. This component adds ammo belts throughout      the game as well as adding some bags of holding to the original Icewind Dale      and Heart of Winter areas. This component also alters normal bags of holding      (both the TotLM ones as      well as the new ones) to hold any type of items. By default, you could not      place armor, miscellaneous items, and some shields into them. Ammo belts      are added to Conlan, Lehland, Emmeric, and Hobart (TotLM)      and Bags of Holding are added to Orrick the Grey, Bandoth, and Kiernan Nye      (TotLM). </p>
      <p><strong>Portable Containers (Zed Nocear)</strong><br />
        <em>BG (requires TotSC)</em></p>
      <p> When Baldur's Gate was created, it was not designed with bags of holding in mind. Tioma's      Ease-of-Use and Chosen of Mystra's Dark Side of the Sword Coast have methods that worked      but were limited. Now there is another. Using Zed Nocear's work from the Polish mod <em><strong>Tajemnice Wybrzeza Mieczy</strong></em> (Mysteries of the Sword Coast), this       component adds five portable containers to the game. These are      different from containers in other games such as BG2 because of engine differences.</p>
      <p><strong>Exotic Items Pack</strong><br />
        <em>BGEE,   EET,      BGT, Tutu</em></p>
      <p> This component adds a handful of weapons and items available in Baldur's
        Gate II and scatters them throughout stores, creatures, and containers in
        the Baldur's Gate portion of the game. Items include katanas, wakizashis,
        scimitars, ninja-tos, bags/quivers of plenty, ioun stones, and a handful
        of spell scrolls. However, please note that the items have been placed with
        an eye towards balance and likelihood that they would be on the Sword Coast
        at all. The exceptions are scimitars, which are definitely less exotic than
        the other items and hence more plentiful.</p>
      <p>This component also fixes a known bug in the game, in that the merchant
        at Gullykin and the Helm temple in Nashkel shared the same store file. </p>
      <p><strong>Reveal City Maps</strong><br />
        <em>BGEE, BGT,  IWDEE,  BG,  IWD,    Tutu, IWD-in-BG2, PsT, PsTEE</em> </p>
      <p> In Baldur's Gate II, city maps were revealed as soon as you entered the area.
        For Baldur's Gate content, this component will reveal the maps of Baldur's Gate, Nashkel, Beregost,
        Candlekeep, and (if Tales of the Sword Coast is installed) Ulgoth's Beard.
        For Icewind Dale content, the maps of Easthaven, Kuldahar, and Lonelywood will be revealed. </p>
      <p><strong>Do Not Reveal City Maps</strong><br />
        <em> BG2EE,  EET,  BG2,    BGT </em> </p>
      <p> In Baldur's Gate II, city maps were revealed as soon as you entered the area.
        This component will change BG2 city maps to no longer be revealed, forcing exploration of the area.</p>
      <p><strong>Add Map Notes</strong><br />
        <em>Tutu, IWD-in-BG2</em></p>
      <p> This component will add map notes to many areas throughout
        the game, including some wilderness areas. This process is done interactively,
        so no areas are overwritten. </p>
      <p><strong>Stores Sell Larger Stacks of Items</strong><br />
        <em>All games except PsT, PsTEE</em></p>
      <p> This component will alter all stores in the game to use higher stacks of
        arrows, bolts, bullets, darts, throwing axes, throwing daggers, and (where available) throwing hammers. This
        component will affect <em>all</em> stores in the game, including ones introduced
        by mods. </p>
      <p><strong>Reputation Resets at Beginning of BG2</strong><br />
        <em> BGT</em></p>
      <p> When making the transition from the end of Baldur's Gate to the beginning
        of Baldur's Gate II, this component will reset the party's reputation back
        to its default value (from 8-12, depending on the protagonist's alignment).
        It doesn't make sense that the party could emerge from the opening dungeon,
        head over to the Adventurer's Mart, and get hero discounts (or villain markups)
        from Ribald. Despite the events of Baldur's Gate, the protagonist and the
        party are more or less unknown in Amn. </p>
      <p><strong>Gems and Potions Require Identification</strong><br />
        <em>All games except PsT, PsTEE</em></p>
      <p> This component assigns a lore value to gems and potions, meaning that they
        now require identification. Lore value is calculated by an algorithm based
        on the value of the item, but smaller gems and lesser potions should still
        be fairly easy to identify by the party. The component has the option to be applied to just gems, just potions, or both. </p>
      <p><strong>Shapeshifter Rebalancing (Weimer)</strong><br />
        <em>BGEE, BG2EE, IWDEE, EET,  BG2,    BGT, Tutu, IWD-in-BG2</em></p>
      <p> Please note that this is a legacy component from Wes Weimer's Ease of Use
        mod. Wes typically designed for balance under the assumption that people
        would have the Tactics mod installed, so this is probably overpowered for
        most normal games. The rest of the description is from the original Ease of Use readme: </p>
      <div class="quote">
        <p> Shapeshifter abilities now create &quot;symbolic paws&quot;. When you wield
          one you turn into a Werewolf, when you remove it you're human again. There
          are no possible exploits and you may choose whether to put the paw in your
          on-hand or off-hand. Since your off-hand THAC0 as
          a pure druid is, shall we say, sub-optimal, I recommend the on-hand. This
          fixes the bug where the Shapeshifter's paws could be dispelled and then any
          weapon could be put in their place. That exploit essentially gave you two
          extra attacks with whatever you wanted, plus all the werewolf powers. </p>
        <p>This also fixes a &quot;bug&quot; where attributes of the <abbr title="creature">CRE</abbr> file
          for &quot;PC polymorphed into
          a Werewolf&quot; were not actually given to the PC by
          the Polymorph opcode. For a normal werewolf: </p>

          etc. </p>
        <p>The &quot;Rebalancing&quot; gives a greater werewolf shapeshifter the +7 HP per
          Level due to a fighter with 25 CON (before
          you just got +2). Most importantly, shapeshifters may now cast spells while
          shapechanged. Yuan-Ti, Githyanki, Sahuagin, etc. can all cast spells--why
          not wolfmen? </p>
        <p>In addition, the Druid spell choices were a bit weak in some areas, so some
          Priest-only spells were made Priest-Druid: Sanctuary (sylvan sanctuaries
          abound), Chant (they got Bless, why not Chant?), Zone of Sweet Air (sounds
          nature-y to me!), Glyph of Warding (no excuse, but they need a damaging spell
          here that isn't Call Lightning), Righteous Magic (listen to Jaheira for a
          while and tell me she's not Righteous ... more importantly, if they're going
          to tank around they need some extra help).</p>
        <p>Finally, 99% of all sixth-level druid spell slots go to &quot;Summon Fire
          Elemental&quot;. You can get a 24 hit dice monster with +4 claws that lasts
          for hours with that spell. It's so much better than the 7th level &quot;Summon
          Earth Elemental&quot; that it isn't funny. The other 6th-level summons just
          don't come close. To give you some actual choices, &quot;Conjure Animals&quot; has
          been changed to summon two 20 HD Greater
          Bearweres (they're like Greater Wolfweres). However, the duration remains
          4 turns. Do you want Fire Elementals forever or Mighty Big Tanks for a short
          time? You decide. </p>
      </div>
      <p><strong>Multiple Strongholds (Sabre, Baldurdash, Weimer) </strong><br />
        <em> BG2EE,  EET,  BG2, BGT</em></p>
      <p> This component comes in two variants. The first is the original from Ease
        of Use, which allows any character, regardless of class, to acquire as many
        strongholds as wanted. The second variant is similar, but retains the class
        restrictions--so a fighter-mage can acquire the Planar Sphere and de'Arnise
        Keep, but would not be offered the Thieves' Guild or membership in the Noble
        Order of the Radiant Heart. In the original game, you were also not able
        to decline the Five Flagons Playhouse, the cabin in the Umar Hills, or the
        Druid Grove. In either variant of this component, the player can now decline
        these strongholds when offered. </p>
      <p><strong>Make Individual Strongholds Available (DavidW) </strong><br />
      <em> BG2EE,  EET,  BG2, BGT; only available if Multiple Strongholds not installed</em></p>
      <p>If you choose not to utilize either of the Multiple Stronghold variants in the previous component, you can choose to enable individual strongholds. This is a series of components that will ask about each of the seven BG2 strongholds individually. </p>
      <p><strong>Bonus Merchants (Baldurdash, Weimer) </strong><br />
        <em> BG2, BGT</em></p>
      <p>This adds Joluv and Diedre to the Copper Coronet and Ribald's Mart, respectively. </p>
      <p><strong>Female Edwina (Davide Carte, Wendy Yung, Weimer) </strong><br />
        <em>BG2EE,  EET,  BG2, BGT</em></p>
      <p>This patch gives Edwina a female portrait to go with her female soundset
        and female paper doll. This patch was originally written by Davide Carte.
        This version includes Wendy Yung's &quot;Edwina&quot; portrait, a modified
        version of the original BG2 art
        (thus it looks seamlessly like part of the original game). </p>
      <p> You can override the portrait by putting your own Royo4L.bmp and Royo4S.bmp

      <p> <strong>Romance Bug Fixes (Sabre, Richardson)</strong><br />
        <em>BG2, BGT</em><br />
        <em>Skipped if already fixed by the BG2 Fixpack</em></p>
      <p> This module applies some bug fixes to the romance scripts. It's highly recommended
        that you at least install this module to fix a few glitches in the original
        game romance scripts. If the <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/mods/fixes/bg2fixpack/">BG2</a><a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/mods/fixes/bg2fixpack/"> Fixpack</a> is
        installed, this component will be skipped as this fix is already included
        in the Fixpack Core Fixes. </p>
      <p> <strong>Imoen ToB Dialogue Fix (jcompton)</strong> <br />
        <em>BG2 (requires ToB), BGT<br />
        </em><em>Skipped if already fixed by the BG2 Fixpack</em></p>
      <p> This fixes about 15 places where Imoen had banter dialogue in ToB but
        you couldn't see it because of a spelling error in the game. If the <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/mods/fixes/bg2fixpack/">BG2</a><a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/mods/fixes/bg2fixpack/"> Fixpack</a> is
        installed, this component will be skipped as this fix is already included
        in the Fixpack Core Fixes. </p>
      <p> <strong>Use BG Walking Speeds </strong><br />
        <em>BGEE, BG2EE, IWDEE, EET,  BG2,    BGT, Tutu, IWD-in-BG2</em> </p>
      <p> From Tutufix, this will make humanoids walk slower, as they did in the original
        Baldur's Gate. While it's most useful for Tutu and BGT players,
        you will be able to install it on several other platforms.
        Because the animations were not meant to walk at these slower speeds, the player may experience some quirkiness when interacting with haste/slow effects or polymorphs. </p>
      <p> <strong>Allow Cromwell to Upgrade Watcher's Keep Items</strong><br />
        <em> BG2EE,  EET,  BG2 (requires ToB),    BGT</em></p>
      <p> It's never made sense to me that Cromwell can forge armor out of red dragon
        scales, ankheg shells, and shadow dragon armor--but doesn't even acknowledge
        the white dragon scales you can acquire in Watcher's Keep. This component
        will allow Cromwell to forge items found in Watcher's Keep using the same
        formulae as Cespenar. (Note that only the formulae using items you can <em>legally</em> obtain
        in SoA are implemented; if you
        cheat in a component from Sendai's Enclave you'll still be out of luck.)
        This component will allow the party to obtain some high-level items in Shadows
        of Amn, so be warned that this may ruin the balance in SoA and make the remainder
        of the game fairly easy. The component will make one minor tweak to Cespenar
        as well--normally, he can only add the electric head to the Flail of Ages
        after the poison head has been attached. This component will allow him to
        add the heads in any order. </p>
      <p><strong>Adjust Cromwell's Forging Time</strong><br />
        <em> BG2EE,  EET,  BG2,    BGT</em></p>
      <p>When you commission Cromwell for a special item, he says the forging will take a day to complete. In BG2, the forging is actually instant and in BG2EE the forging actually takes 24 hours (16 hours of work plus 8 hours of sleep). This component allows you to choose the length of forging time to be instant (like BG2), a full 24 hours (like BG2EE), or a third option that takes a workday (eight hours) to forge items. </p>
      <p> <strong>Give Cespenar Cromwell's Recipes</strong><br />
        <em>BG2EE,  EET,  BG2 (requires ToB),    BGT</em></p>
      <p>Much like the <strong>Allow Cromwell to Upgrade Watcher's Keep Items</strong> component, Cespenar's inability to forge shadow or red dragon scales into armor is nonsensical. This component will allow Cespenar to forge the same eight items that Cromwell can, with the same components and prices. Also like the previous components, this will make one minor tweak to Cespenar
        as well--normally, he can only add the electric head to the Flail of Ages
        after the poison head has been attached. This component will allow him to
        add the heads in any order. </p>
      <p><strong>Friendly Arm Inn Hidden Container Restoration (plainab)</strong><br />
        <em>BG (without TotSC)</em></p>
      <p> There is a hidden container with a magic ring in early versions of Baldur's Gate. It      was removed with the 4315 patch, then restored with Tales of the Sword Coast. If you      don't have the official expansion, then this will restore this very helpful Easter egg. </p>
      <p><strong>Move NPCs to Convenient Locations</strong><br />
        <em>BGEE,   EET, BG,     BGT, Tutu</em> </p>
      <p> Adapted from the BG1 NPC Project and SCS mods, this series of components allows you to move Alora, Eldoth, Quayle, Shar-Teel, Tiax, and Viconia so they      can be found earlier in the game, and is compatible with Send BioWare NPC's to an Inn. <em>You must start a new game for these changes to take effect on non-BGT games.</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Alora will be found in Gullykin, near the winery door. Her initial dialog has been       changed to reflect her new location. (Note: Dialog may not change in games without Tales      of the Sword Coast installed.)</li>
        <li>Eldoth moves to the Sword Coast Way, south of the Friendly Arm Inn.</li>
        <li>Quayle will be available at the Nashkel Carnival near the Great Gazib.</li>
        <li>Shar-Teel moves to the area north of Nashkel.</li>
        <li>Tiax will start on the first floor of Feldpost's Inn. </li>
        <li>Viconia moves to the road south of Beregost.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Bardic Reputation Adjustment </strong><br />
        <em>BG (requires TotSC)</em></p>
      <p> This component was also modified from the BG1 NPC Project. From the Readme: </p>
      <div class="quote">
        <p>This component places three Bards in three inns scattered on the Sword Coast. Each can be       hired to spread your fearsome reputation around, decreasing your reputation. The amount of        money this costs is dependent on your current reputation and how much of a reputation       hit you seek. This allows players to manipulate reputation both upwards through temple        donations, and downwards through the spread of rumors (for those of us who hate killing an        innocent just to keep neutral or evil NPCs happy).</p>
      </div>
      <p> <strong>Change Cloakwood Mine Chapter End Change Trigger to Non-TotSC Behavior (plainab)     (BETA) </strong><br />
        <em>BGEE,   EET, BG (requires TotSC),   BGT, Tutu</em></p>
      <p> In basic Baldur's Gate the Cloakwood Mine chapter did not end with the death of Daveorn.      It ended when you tried to leave the level after his death, whether by the lift or back up      the stairs. This component restores that method, allowing you to plunder his lair first. </p>
      <p><em>NOTE:</em> This component is considered BETA because it has had only limited testing.</p>
      <p><strong>Game Ends When the Main Character Dies</strong><br />
        <em>IWDEE, IWD-in-BG2 </em></p>
      <p>By default, in IWD-in-BG2 - as with the original IWD - the game   ends only when the whole party is killed. If you install this component,   the game instead behaves like Baldur's Gate: if your main character   dies, it's game over.</p>
      <p><strong>NPCs Respond to the Main Character, Not to Whichever Character Talks to Them</strong><br />
        <em>IWDEE, IWD, IWD-in-BG2 </em></p>
      <p>By default, in IWD-in-BG2 - as with the original IWD - people you   talk to address their comments to whichever party member started the   conversation.      If you install this component, the game instead behaves like   Baldur's Gate: all NPCs talk to your main character, even if you   initiate conversation using some other character.</p>
      <p><strong>Make Heart of Winter Accessible at Any Level</strong><br />
        <em>IWDEE, IWD (requires HoW), IWD-in-BG2 </em></p>
      <p>With this component installed, Hjollder will no longer refuse to take you to Lonelywood if you are too-low level.</p>
      <p><strong>Restore BG2 Spells and Make Scrolls Available</strong><br />
        <em>IWD-in-BG2</em></p>
      <p>By default, IWD-in-BG2 contains only Icewind Dale spells: no   Contingencies, Timestops, and the like. This component restores the BG2   spells not already found in Icewind Dale. (Spells that function   differently in IWD continue to function differently.)</p>
      <p>The component also places exactly one scroll of each restored   wizard spell in a store. Spells of level 6 or below are found in Orrick   the Grey's store. Higher-level spells      are distributed randomly between Edion, Bandoth, Kieran, and Nym.</p>
      <p>Note that the BG2 spells have a different artistic style from the IWD spells, which may appear jarring.</p>
      <p>The &quot;Find Familiar&quot; spell <strong>is</strong> restored, but I don't recommend   using it, as the familiars summoned will be over-powerful for the early   stages of the game.</p>
      <p><strong>NPCs Cannot Pass Doors</strong><br />
        <em>BG2(EE), Tutu, BGT, EET, BGEE, IWDEE</em></p>
      <p>This component will prevent non-party NPCs from traveling between areas, which was the default behavior for the original Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale games. </p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>These components make alterations to rules, game mechanics, and other aspects

      <p><strong>Two-Handed Bastard Swords</strong><br />
        <em>BGEE, BG2EE, IWDEE, EET, BG, BG2, IWD,   BGT, Tutu, IWD-in-BG2</em></p>
      <p> It always seemed odd that the general description of bastard swords implied
        they could be wielded with two hands. This tweak adds an ability to all
        bastard swords that will create a two-handed version of the sword in your
        inventory. The one-handed version will be removed. The new sword will have
        the animation of a two-handed sword but, in all other respects, will be
        the same as the one-handed version. You can switch back to the one-handed
        version at any time. The ability is found behind the backpack icon, once
        the sword is equipped. This component will  affect items introduced
        by mods. </p>
      <p><em>Note:</em> Instances may occur when a bastard sword appears to have
        a selling price of 1 gp. Resting will
        fix this.</p>
      <p><strong>Two-Handed Katanas<br />
        </strong><em>BGEE, BG2EE, IWDEE, EET,  BG2,  BGT, Tutu, IWD-in-BG2</em></p>
      <p> This tweak adds an ability to all katanas that will create a two-handed version
        of the sword in your inventory. The one-handed version will be removed. The
        new sword will have the animation of a two-handed sword but, in all other
        respects, will be the same as the one-handed version. You can switch back
        to the one-handed version at any time. The ability is found behind the backpack
        icon, once the sword is equipped. Monks cannot wield two-handed katanas.
        This component will  affect items introduced by mods. </p>
      <p><em>Note:</em> Instances may occur when a katana appears to have a selling
        price of 1 gp. Resting will fix this.</p>
      <p><strong>Two-Handed Axes</strong><br />
        <em>BGEE, BG2EE, IWDEE, EET, BG, BG2, IWD,   BGT, Tutu, IWD-in-BG2</em></p>
      <p> A nod to Icewind Dale, this tweak adds an ability to all melee-only axes that will create a two-handed version
        of the axe in your inventory. The one-handed version will be removed. The
        new axe will have the animation of a two-handed halberd but, in all other
        respects, will be the same as the one-handed version. You can switch back
        to the one-handed version at any time. The ability is found behind the backpack
        icon, once the axe is equipped. This component will  affect items introduced by mods. Axes that are two-handed by default will remain two-handed. Please note that this component does not add any two-handed axes to the game; please see <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/mods/spells/iwdification/">IWDification</a> or other mods for that. </p>
      <p><em>Note:</em> Instances may occur when an axe appears to have a selling
        price of 1 gp. Resting will fix this.</p>
      <p><strong>Universal Clubs</strong><br />
        <em>BGEE, BG2EE, IWDEE, EET, BG, BG2, IWD,   BGT, Tutu, IWD-in-BG2</em></p>
      <p> From the description of a basic club in BG2:
        'Anyone can find a good stout piece of wood and swing it'--so why can't mages
        use clubs? This tweak allows mages to wield clubs as well as gain a proficiency
        point in clubs. This component will affect <em>all</em> items in the game,
        including items introduced by mods.</p>
      <p><strong>Weapon Styles for All</strong><br />
        <em>BGEE, BG2EE, IWDEE, EET,  BG2,    BGT, Tutu, IWD-in-BG2</em></p>
      <p> This allows all classes, not just warriors, to gain the maximum number of
        points in the various weapon styles. Some restrictions remain:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Mages are not allowed Sword and Shield Style (they can't use shields
          anyway).</li>
        <li>Kensais are not allowed Sword and Shield Style (they can't use shields
          anyway).</li>
        <li>Monks are only allowed Single Weapon Style.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>Note:</em> This component affects weapon <em>styles</em>, <em>weapon
        proficiencies</em> remain unaffected.</p>
      <p><strong>Delay High Level Abilities</strong><br />
        <em> BG2EE,  EET,  BG2 (requires ToB),    BGT</em></p>
      <p> High Level Abilities start at level 21 for all classes. </p>
      <p><strong>Change Experience Point Cap</strong><br />
        <em>All games except IWD2</em></p>
      <p> All games impose an experience cap. For example, in Baldur's Gate II, characters have a maximum experience point cap of 2,950,000
        with Shadows of Amn or 8,000,000 with Throne of Bhaal. In Tutu and Baldur's
        Gate, these caps are 89,000 in the standard game and 161,000 with the
        Tales of the Sword Coast expansion. This component will allow you to alter
        the experience point cap in one of three ways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Remove completely (characters can advance without restriction up to level
          50) </li>
        <li>Cap at level 20 (not available on all platforms)</li>
        <li>Cap at level 30  (not available on all platforms)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For a challenge, combine the level 20 cap with Delay High Level Abilities in BG2 
        to never get access to UAI and Improved
        Alacrity. </p>
      <p><strong>Allow Stealth and Thieving Abilities in Heavy Armor per P&amp;P</strong><br />
        <em>All games except IWD2</em></p>
      <p> Thieves and rangers are
        prevented from using stealth and thieving skills while in heavy armor. This
        component implements the P&amp;P method
        of allowing these abilities in heavier armor, but at a penalty to the character.
        There is always a small chance of success or failure regardless of the adjustments
        below. Any armor above leather will impose penalties on these skills. This
        component will affect some mod items; if you find armor not affected by these
        tweaks, please report it at the <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forum/34-tweaks-anthology-forum/">Tweak
        Packs forums</a>. The adjustment of the item descriptions to reflect these
        changes has now been incorporated directly into this component and is done
        on-the-fly, so it should also catch mod-added items and reduce conflicts.
        (Note that descriptions are only adjusted if there are translations available.) </p>
      <p>In older versions of the engine (original BG and IWD), Move Silently and Hide in Shadows were  a single stat called Stealth, and the armor changes in those games will just adjust Stealth. From the <em>Complete Book of Thieves</em>, by armor type:</p>

      <p><strong>Allow Arcane Spellcasting in Armor</strong><br />
        <em>All games except IWD2</em></p>
      <p> This component will allow mages with access to armor the ability to wear
        it and cast arcane magic, though at a miscast penalty. It will not allow
        mages to wear armor they normally can't, but it will broaden the selection
        for multi and dual-class mages. The penalty will not affect divine magic.
        This component will affect some mod items; if you find armor not affected
        by these tweaks, please report it at the <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forum/34-tweaks-anthology-forum/">Tweak

      <p><strong>Expanded Dual-Class Options</strong><br />
        <em>BGEE, BG2EE, IWDEE, EET,  BG2,    BGT, Tutu, IWD-in-BG2</em></p>
      <p> This component will allow Barbarians and Wild Mages to dual-class to other
        classes. Barbarians will have the same dual-class options (cleric, druid,
        mage, and thief) with the same requirement (15 strength) as fighters. Wild
        Mages will have the same dual-class options (cleric, fighter, and thief)
        with the same requirement (15 intelligence) as regular mages. </p>
      <p><strong>Wear Multiple Protection Items</strong><br />
        <em>All games except IWD2, PsT, PsTEE</em></p>
      <p> This component allows players to wear more than one &quot;X of Protection&quot; item
        at a time. Players have their choice of two different implementations (originally from
        Ease of Use and G3/Tutu
        Tweaks respectively):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>No restrictions. Players can wear as many items together as they wish. </li>
        <li> P&amp;P Style: In Pen and Paper AD&amp;D,
          characters are allowed to wear magical armor with Rings/Cloaks/Amulets
          of Protection, but only the armor class bonus from one item would apply.
          This component gives every ring/cloak/amulet of protection the ability
          to be worn with or without its Armor Class bonus. With the AC bonus,
          the items retain their usual restrictions from being worn with other protection
          items or magic armor. Without their AC bonus,
          they can be worn together. This allows players to gain the benefits of
          the saving throw bonuses from the items of protection. To toggle between
          the versions that offer armor class bonuses and those without, use the
          item's special ability--the new item will be created in your inventory. </li>
        <li>Allow Armor Plus One Protection Item: The player can wear magical armor plus one more protection item. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Alter Weapon Proficiency System</strong><br />
        <em>BGEE, BG2EE, IWDEE, EET,  BG2,    BGT, Tutu, IWD-in-BG2</em></p>
      <p> This component provides five different options to allow you to change how
        the weapon proficiency system works. </p>
      <p> The first option, Rebalanced Weapon Proficiencies, attempts to rebalance
        the groupings of weapons proficiencies. There are three main changes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Wakizashis move from Wakizashi/Scimitar/Ninja-to to Katana proficiency</li>
        <li> Ninja-tos move from Wakizashi/Scimitar/Ninja-to to Short Sword proficiency</li>
        <li> Morningstars move from Flail/Morningstar to Mace proficiency</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Wakizashis are very similar to katanas in usage, and ninja-tos are straight,
        short blades. Morningstars, while there are several variations in definition,
        are essentially spiked maces in the game, and have been moved out of the
        flail category and grouped with maces. The proficiencies themselves get renamed
        to reflect these changes. Weapon descriptions also get updated if the translations are available. </p>
      <p>The second and third options are variants of using the old BG-style
        system of proficiencies. In BG,
        the weapons proficiencies were not as specialized (i.e. Large Swords covered
        bastard swords, two-handed swords, and long swords) and there were only eight
        categories. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Bastard swords, long swords, two-handed swords, katanas, scimitars, wakizashis, and ninja-tos are combined into the Large Sword proficiency. </li>
        <li>Shorts swords and daggers are combined into the Small Sword proficiency. </li>
        <li>Hammers, maces, staves and clubs are combined into the Blunt proficiency.</li>
        <li>Flails and morningstars are now the Spiked proficiency.</li>
        <li>Halberds and spears are combined in the Spear proficiency</li>
        <li>Crossbows, darts, and slings are combined in the Missile Weapon proficiency. </li>
        <li>Long and short bows are combined in  the Bow proficiency. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>While mainly aimed at Tutu and BGT players
        to allow them to have a game experience closer to BG,
        these two options will work on any of the games listed in availability.
        The two options only vary in allowing the weapon style proficiencies (i.e.
        Two-Handed Weapon Style, Single Weapon Style, etc.) to be included or not
        at the player's discretion. If you import your characters to another game
        without this component you will need to use Shadowkeeper to change their
        proficiencies to the standard BG2 set. </p>
      <p>The fourth and fifth options implement the Icewind Dale style proficiency system. Like the BG-style option, there are fewer proficiencies, but it's not as concentrated as the BG-style system.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Bastard swords and two-handed swords are combined into the Great Sword proficiency.</li>
        <li>Long swords, katanas, scimitars, wakizashis, and ninja-tos are combined into the Large Sword proficiency. </li>
        <li>The Flail/Morningstar proficiency is renamed  Flail proficiency and morningstars are moved into the Mace proficiency.</li>
        <li>Darts, and slings are combined in the Missile Weapon proficiency. </li>
        <li>Long and short bows are combined in the  Bow proficiency. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>IWD-style proficiencies also come with the option to keep or remove the weapon style proficiencies. </p>
      <p><strong>Cast Spells from Scrolls (and Other Items) at Character Level</strong><br />
        <em>All games</em></p>
      <p> Scrolls and a few other items allow your party to cast spells from the item.
        When cast in this fashion, the spell is cast as if the character using
        the item is at a fixed level (for example, 10 in BG2 or 6 in BG) in terms of determining damages, durations, etc.
        This tweak will allow you to cast spells from items at your character's 
        level, instead of the fixed value. One item to note here--the game will use your character's mage level; if you're in the habit of casting scrolls with your thief via Use Any Item, the spell will likely be cast at a minimum level. </p>
      <p><strong>Shopkeepers Have Limited Identification Ability </strong> <br />
        <em>All games except IWD2</em></p>
      <p> This component makes the identification abilities of stores more in line
        with the shopkeepers' abilities. There are three ways to implement this,
        and players are given a choice:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Only mages and bards can identify items. Any non-mage, non-bard shopkeeper
          cannot identify items at all. Mages and bards can identify any item.</li>
        <li>Identification based on lore. Any shopkeeper can identify items up to
          their personal lore value, regardless of class. The shopkeepers are given
          a slight lore boost over normal characters to reflect their occupational
          experience with magical items. Items with exceptionally high lore may not
          be able to be identified at all by shopkeepers. </li>
        <li>Hybrid. Mage and bard shopkeepers can identify anything, and other shopkeepers
          use lore scores based on their character. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Multi-Class Grandmastery (Weimer)</strong><br />
        <em>All games except IWD2, PsT, PsTEE</em></p>
      <p> This is for players who believe that AD&amp;D's dual-class
        and multi-class system is inherently broken and that there is no conceptual
        reason for multi-class characters to be denied grandmastery. Multi-class
        characters can now put more than two pips in things. In effect, any multi-class
        character that could put two stars in anything can now put five stars in
        that thing. </p>
      <p><strong>Change Grandmastery Bonuses</strong><br />
      <em>All games except IWD2</em></p>
      <p> The first option, 'True Grandmastery', is the standard Baldurdash / TeamBG &quot;un-nerfed&quot; grandmastery
        patch. In IWD, BG and AD&amp;D guidelines,
        going from four to five proficiency points in a weapon reduces THAC0 by
        one, adds one to damage rolls, and gives an extra attack per round to 5/2.
        In BG2, it only adds one to damage.
        Rather takes the &quot;Grand&quot; out of &quot;Grandmastery&quot; I think. Install this patch
        to restore Grandmastery to what it was. </p>
      <p>The second option allows you to use the BG2 grandmastery in other games. </p>
      <p><strong>Change Magically Created Weapons to Zero Weight</strong><br />
        <em>All games except PsT, PsTEE</em></p>
      <p> Nearly all magically created items in BG2 have
        zero weight, though there are a few exceptions. The reasoning is that if you had a low-strength mage, he or she could become encumbered by a weapon they can't drop. This component will change
        items such as Melf's Minute Meteors, Jan's Flasher Master Bruiser Mates, weapons created
        by Enchanted Weapon, Decastave, Shillelagh, and a few others to have zero weight. This
        component will  affect items introduced by mods.</p>
      <p><strong>Make +x/+y Weapons Consistent</strong><br />
        <em> BG2, BGT<br />
        Skipped if BG2 Fixpack installed </em></p>
      <p> The engine does not handle weapons such as the Bastard Sword +1/+3 vs. Shapeshifters,
        Hammer +1/+4 vs. Giantkin, and Daystar +2/+4 vs. Evil Creatures consistently.
        In all but a few cases, the weapon uses the higher of the two bonuses as
        its enchantment level, which determines what the weapon can hit--for example,
        spell protections such as Mantle or creatures such as Kangaxx. This component
        will make all weapons of this nature use the higher of the two bonuses
        as their enchantment; i.e. Daystar will be treated as a +4 weapon. If the <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/mods/fixes/bg2fixpack/">BG2</a><a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/mods/fixes/bg2fixpack/"> Fixpack</a> is
        installed, this component will be skipped as this fix is already included
        in the Fixpack Core Fixes. </p>
      <p><strong>Description Updates for Make +x/+y Weapons Consistent Component</strong><br />
        <em>BG2, BGT<br />
        </em> <em>Requires Make +x/+y Weapons Consistent</em></p>
      <p> This component will update the descriptions of items altered by the Make
        +x/+y Weapons Consistent component to reflect their adjusted enchantment
        level. </p>
      <p><em>Warning</em>: If another mod has altered one of the items, the
        descriptions added by this component may not be accurate as they are based
        on an unmodded game. This will not affect gameplay or the ability of the
        items, as the descriptions are purely cosmetic. This component will detect
        Ashes of Embers and adjust descriptions accordingly.</p>
      <p><strong>Un-Nerfed THAC0 Table</strong><br />
      <em>All games except IWD2</em></p>
      <p>A spin-off of the deprecated Un-Nerfed THAC0 Table,
        Saving Throws, Grand-Mastery, and Arcane, Divine Spell Progression component,
        this allows the player to select the un-nerfed THAC0 table
        individually. THAC0 can now
        progress until it reaches zero instead of no longer improving once you hit
        level 20. </p>
      <p><strong>Un-Nerfed Sorcerer Spell Progression Table<br />
        </strong><em>All games except IWD2</em></p>
      <p>This is the same table from the deprecated Un-Nerfed THAC0 Table,
        Saving Throws, Grand-Mastery, and Arcane, Divine Spell Progression component,
        now available individually. A <a href="https://gibberlings3.github.io/Documentation/readmes/readme-cdtweaks_tables.html#sorcerer">comparison
        of the spell progression tables</a> is available. </p>
      <p><strong>Alter Mage Spell Progression Table</strong><br />
      <em>All games except IWD2</em></p>
      <p>This component offers two variants for mage spell progression. The
        first option is the same table from the deprecated Un-Nerfed THAC0 Table,
        Saving Throws, Grand-Mastery, and Arcane, Divine Spell Progression component
        and the second is the progression table from P&amp;P,
        previously available in the P&amp;P Spell
        Progression Tables component. A <a href="https://gibberlings3.github.io/Documentation/readmes/readme-cdtweaks_tables.html#mage">comparison
        of the spell progression tables</a> is available. </p>
      <p><strong>Alter Bard Spell Progression Table</strong><br />
      <em>All games except IWD2</em></p>
      <p> This component offers two variants for bard spell progression. The
        first option is the same table from the deprecated Un-Nerfed THAC0 Table,
        Saving Throws, Grand-Mastery, and Arcane, Divine Spell Progression component
        and the second is the progression table from P&amp;P,
        previously available in the P&amp;P Spell
        Progression Tables component. A <a href="https://gibberlings3.github.io/Documentation/readmes/readme-cdtweaks_tables.html#bard">comparison
        of the spell progression tables</a> is available. </p>
      <p><strong>Alter Cleric Spell Progression Table</strong><br />
      <em>All games except IWD2</em></p>
      <p> This component offers two variants for cleric spell progression.
        The first option is the same table from the deprecated Un-Nerfed THAC0 Table,
        Saving Throws, Grand-Mastery, and Arcane, Divine Spell Progression component
        and the second is the progression table from P&amp;P,
        previously available in the P&amp;P Spell
        Progression Tables component. A <a href="https://gibberlings3.github.io/Documentation/readmes/readme-cdtweaks_tables.html#cleric">comparison
        of the spell progression tables</a> is available. </p>
      <p><strong>Alter Druid Spell and Level Progression Tables</strong><br />
      <em>All games except IWD2</em></p>
      <p> This component is actually the combination and streamlining of three
        different components: P&amp;P Spell
        Progression Tables;, Un-Nerfed THAC0 Table,
        Saving Throws, Grand-Mastery, and Arcane, Divine Spell Progression; and Druids
        Use Cleric Level and Spell Progression. These are now combined and made more
        granular so that the player can select exactly which level and spell progression
        tables they wish to use. A <a href="https://gibberlings3.github.io/Documentation/readmes/readme-cdtweaks_tables.html#druid">comparison
        of the spell progression tables</a> is available. </p>
      <p><strong>Triple-Class HLA Tables</strong><br />
        <em> BG2EE,  EET,  BG2 (requires ToB), BGT<br />
        </em> <em>Requires Change Experience Point Cap - Remove completely</em> </p>
      <p> This component will max out the HLA tables
        for fighter-mage-thieves and fighter-mage-clerics. Throne of Bhaal originally
        used the fighter-thief table for fighter-mage-thieves and the fighter-cleric
        table for fighter-mage-clerics. Both BG2EE and BG2 (with the BG2 Fixpack
        installed) alter this so that the triple-classes have unique tables and
        add the three Extra 6/7/8 Level Spell HLAs from
        the mage tables. This component adds even more mage HLAs to
        the tables, at the expense of other HLAs from
        the other two classes. Fighter-mage-clerics lose access to Deathblow, Greater
        Deathblow, and War Cry and gain access to Improved Alacrity, Dragon's Breath,
        Summon (Dark) Planetar, and Comet. Fighter-mage-thieves lose access to Deathblow,
        Greater Deathblow, War Cry, Alchemy, and Scribe Scrolls and gain access to
        Energy Blades, Improved Alacrity, Dragon's Breath, Summon (Dark) Planetar,
        and Comet. Since triple-classes require 9 million XP to
        reach a level where they can use 9th level mage spells, this component requires
        removal of the experience point cap. </p>
      <p> <strong>Add Save Penalties for Spells Cast by High-Level Casters </strong><br />
        <em>All games</em></p>
      <p> By request, this component will adjust spells to have save penalties when
        cast by high-level casters. For every five levels over the minimum level
        required to learn a spell, a -1 to saves will be imposed. </p>
      <p> For example, Hold Person is a second level cleric spell, and can be learned
        when a character hits level three. When the character hits level eight, the
        spell now has a -1 penalty to the victim's saving throw. At level 13 it's
        -2; at 18 it's -3, etc. all the way out to -9 at level 48. The penalties
        are extended out to level 50 in case players are playing an XP cap-free game
        or with one of the various level-50 rule sets. </p>
      <p> The penalties will work against you for spells from enemies, but I expect
        this component will, in general, probably make the game a lot easier. You'll
        have the choice to add these penalties to divine spells, arcane spells, or
        both. </p>
      <p> <strong>Trap Cap Removal (Ardanis/GeN1e) </strong><br />
        <em>BGEE, BG2EE, IWDEE, EET,  BG2,    BGT, Tutu, IWD-in-BG2</em></p>
      <p> Courtesy of Ardanis/GeN1e, this component will allow you to bypass the hardcoded
        limit of seven active traps. </p>
      <p> <strong>Remove Delay for Magical Traps (Ardanis/GeN1e) </strong><br />
        <em>BGEE, BG2EE, IWDEE, EET,  BG2,    BGT, Tutu, IWD-in-BG2</em></p>
      <p> Also from Ardanis/GeN1e, this component will remove the triggering delay
        for skull trap, glyph of warding, and delayed blast fireball. This should
        make them more effective during fights. </p>
      <p> <strong>Remove Summoning Cap</strong><br />
        <em>BGEE, BG2EE, IWDEE, EET</em></p>
      <p> This component will remove the artificial limit of six summoned creatures from the game. </p>
      <p> <strong>Remove Summoning Cap for Celestials (Ardanis/GeN1e)</strong><br />
        <em> BG2EE,  EET,  BG2 (requires ToB),    BGT </em></p>
      <p> Courtesy of Ardanis/GeN1e, this component will allow you to bypass the hardcoded
        limit of one active celestial (planetar or deva).</p>
      <p><strong>Alter Multiclass Restrictions</strong><br />
        <em>BGEE, BG2EE, IWDEE, EET,  BG2 (requires TobEx),    BGT (requires TobEx), Tutu (requires TobEx), IWD-in-BG2</em></p>
      <p> This component has five options for changing who can multi-class, though it remains limited by valid multiclass combos in the game. Valid combos are: fighter/mage, fighter/cleric, fighter/thief, fighter/mage/thief, mage/thief, cleric/mage, cleric/thief, fighter/druid, fighter/mage/cleric, and cleric/ranger.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><em>Allow humans to multiclass: </em>This option allows humans to become multiclass characters in any of the allowed combinations. </li>
        <li><em>Allow non-humans access to all multiclass combinations:</em> This will allow any non-human class access to any of the valid  combinations; e.g. dwarves can now be fighter/mages or half-orc fighter-druids. </li>
        <li><em>Allow non-humans access to a multiclasses only if they can access the single-classes:</em> This allows non-humans to access a multiclass if and only if they have access to the single-classes that make up the combo, e.g. dwarves could become a cleric/thief (since they can be both clerics and thieves) but not cleric/mages (since they cannot be mages)</li>
        <li><em>Install options one and two (everyone can multiclass anything):</em> A combination of options one and two, above.</li>
        <li> <em>Install options one and three (everyone can multiclass anything they can single-class):</em> A combination of options one and three, above.</li>
      </ol>
<p>In some cases (and especially without the <strong>Remove Racial Restrictions for Single Classes</strong> component) the entries for the multi-class combos may be missing words. You can select these entries and the text and description will remain correct, and it will work in game. </p>
      <p>One other restriction is that any mage multiclass for gnomes will be replaced with illusionist, so a gnome will be fighter/illusionist/thief instead of a fighter/mage/thief.</p>
      <p> <strong>Remove Racial Restrictions for Single Classes</strong><br />
        <em>BGEE, BG2EE, IWDEE, EET,  BG2 (requires TobEx),    BGT (requires TobEx), Tutu (requires TobEx), IWD-in-BG2</em></p>
      <p>This component will remove the racial restrictions for all single classes, allowing for halfling paladins and half-orc mages. This component will also change the maximum charisma for dwarves to 17, allowing them to be paladins. The one exception is that monks remain human-only; other races do not have a monk animation so the game will crash during character creation. </p>
      <p><em>Please note: </em>the game will freeze during the ability score part of character creation if it reaches a point where a class or kit requires a minimum score in an ability that, due to racial limitations, can't be reached. The only potential instance of this in the unmodded game is the charisma requirement for dwarven paladins (which this component addresses) but it can't account for modded kits or requirements.</p>
      <p> <strong>Alter Dual-class Restrictions</strong><br />
        <em>BGEE, BG2EE, IWDEE, EET</em></p>
      <p> This component allows the player to change how the game handles dual- and multiclassing:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Humans can no longer dual-class:</em> This simply removes the ability of humans to dual-class.</li>
        <li><em>Allow non-humans to dual-class: </em>This option will allow non-humans to option to dual-class. The actual requirements for dual-classing (stat requirements and the like) remain in place. </li>
        <li><em>Change both: </em>This option disallows human dual-classes while allowing non-human dual-classing. In short, the opposite of how the game normally works. </li>

      <p><strong>Remove Racial Restrictions for Kits</strong><br />
        <em>BGEE, BG2EE, IWDEE, EET,  BG2 (requires TobEx),    BGT (requires TobEx), Tutu (requires TobEx), IWD-in-BG2</em></p>
      <p>This component will remove the racial restrictions for all kits though it will not remove the class restrictions (see the previous component). For example, if your selected race can't be a paladin, then the paladin kits remain unavailable. Two hardcoded limitation remains--gnome mages must be illusionists and monks remain human-only; other races do not have a monk animation so the game will crash during character creation. </p>
      <p><em>Please note: </em>the game will freeze during the ability score part of character creation if it reaches a point where a class or kit requires a minimum score in an ability that, due to racial limitations, can't be reached. The only potential instance of this in the unmodded game is the charisma requirement for dwarven paladins (which this component addresses) but it can't account for modded kits or requirements. </p>
      <p><strong>Paladins Use IWD-HoW Spell Progression Tables (grogerson)</strong><br />
        <em>BGEE, BG2EE,  EET, BG, BG2,  IWD2, PsT, PsTEE, BGT, Tutu</em></p>
      <p> Icewind Dale expanded the level and number of spells high level paladins        could cast. This component replaces the game tables with those of IWD-HoW. <em>NOTE:</em> If you are playing BG without the expansion Tales of the Sword Coast a        paladin will not gain access to spells until 10th level due to a hard-coded bug.</p>
      <p><strong>Rangers Use IWD-HoW Spell Progression Tables (grogerson)</strong><br />
        <em>BGEE, BG2EE,  EET, BG, BG2,  IWD2, PsT, PsTEE, BGT, Tutu</em></p>
      <p> Icewind Dale expanded the level and number of spells high level rangers could cast. This component replaces the game tables with those of IWD-HoW. </p>
      <p><strong>Druids Use 3e Alignment Restrictions</strong><br />
        <em>All games except IWD2, PsT, PsTEE</em></p>
      <p> This component will allow druids to be any alignment as long as it lies on      one axis of neutrality (NG, LN, TN, CN, NE),      as in the 3e rules. By default druids can only be True Neutral. This component will also try to find and adjust all druid kits to the new allowed alignments, including the original three druid kits.</p>
      <p><strong>Loosen Item Restrictions for Multi- and Dual-class Clerics</strong><br />
        <em>All games except IWD2, PsT, PsTEE</em></p>
      <p> Multi- and dual-class  clerics retain their restrictions on items,      i.e. a mage-cleric still cannot use daggers and a fighter-cleric can't      use swords. This component will open up more items for cleric      multi- and dual-classes by allowing them to use all items available to      both classes. </p>
      <p><strong>Change Item Restrictions for Multi- and Dual-class Druids</strong><br />
        <em>All games except IWD2, PsT, PsTEE</em></p>
      <p> Multi- and dual-class fighter-druids  retain some druidic restrictions on items,      i.e.  a fighter-druid can't      use a bastard sword, but can wear plate armor. This component will allow the player to make these restrictions consistent, by either loosening restrictions--fighter-druids can use any items available to fighters--or by tightening them as follows: fighter-druids will be allowed amulets, belts, boots, bracers, cloaks, potions, rings, and wands available to fighters, but all other items (such as armor and weapons) will only be available to fighter-druids if single-class druids can use the item. Metallic helmets are also restricted. </p>
      <p><strong>Everyone Gets Bonus APR from Specialization (subtledoctor)</strong><br />
        <em>BGEE, BG2EE, IWDEE, EET</em></p>
      <p>Only warriors (fighters, paladins, rangers) gain extra attacks per round (APR) from specializing (or more) in weapon proficiencies. This component will grant these APR bonuses from specialization to all classes. Warriors will still receive their extra half-attack per round at levels 7 and 13. </p>
      <p><strong>Enforce PnP Proficiency Rules on Dual-Classed Characters (subtledoctor)</strong><br />
        <em>BGE, BG2EE, IWDEE, EET, BG2, BGT, Tutu, IWD-in-BG2</em></p>
      <p>This component is designed to enforce the PnP weapon proficiency rule that you can only advance as far as your <em>current </em>class   allows.&nbsp; Meaning, if you dual from fighter to cleric and you only have   Mastery (+++) in maces, you will NOT be able to advance to Grandmastery   after dual-classing.&nbsp; For technical reasons the limit after   dual-classing from a warrior class to a non-warrior class is actually   Specialization (++), so you can still do a little better than   single-class priests/rogues/wizards. So in short, as far as   proficiencies go, dual-classing is now on par with multiclassing.&nbsp; (But,   you do get to keep any proficiency advancement you achieved <em>before</em> you dual-classed.) </p>
      <p><strong>Exceptional Strength Weight Limit Changes (sarevok57)</strong><br />
        <em>All games except IWD2</em></p>
      <p>This component will alter the weight limit for characters with exceptional strength, meaning strength scores between 18/01 to 18/100. Instead of five distinct tiers of strength scores and weight limits from PnP, every point of exceptional strength will result in an additional two pounds of carrying capacity before your character becomes encumbered. Outside of very low exceptional strength scores (9 or lower), this will increase your character's weight limit and provide a finer gradient of variation within the scores. All other bonuses for exceptional strength (such as THAC0 and damage bonuses) are unchanged. </p>

      <p><strong>Level-Locked Spell Scrolls (Angel)</strong><br />
        <em>BG2, Tutu, BGT, BGEE, BG2EE, IWDEE</em></p>
      <p>This component will restrict casting spells from   scrolls to the level that the spell can normally be cast by a mage, plus one level beyond. For example, a fifth-level mage can memorize and cast spells of level three or below. With this tweak installed the mage would be able to use spell scrolls of level four or below, e.g. they could use a Stoneskin scroll (level four) but not a Cloudkill scroll (level five). These level requirements do not affect the ability of a mage to scribe a spell into their spellbook, just to cast spells from them. </p>
      <p><strong>Allow Mages to Use Bucklers and Thieves to Use Small Shields (Angel)</strong><br />
        <em>All games except IWD2, PsT, PstEE</em></p>
      <p>As it says on the label, this component will allow single-class mages and sorcerers to use bucklers, and allow bards and single-class thieves to use small shields. </p>
      <p><strong>Lightning Bolts Don't Bounce</strong><strong> (Angel)</strong><br />
        <em>All games except IWD2, PsT, PstEE</em></p>
      <p>This component will adjust lightning bolts to no longer bounce. On older engines, such as the original IWD or BG, the bolts are now restricted to a single target and use the call lightning animation (e.g. a bolt from the sky). On newer engines, the bolts continue to use their  animations and can strike multiple targets, they simply no longer bounce off targets or walls. </p>
      <p><strong>Speed Up de'Arnise Keep Stronghold Quests</strong> <br />
      <em>BG2(EE), BGT, EET</em></p>
      <p>This component reduces the time between events at the de'Arnise Keep by 30% to help players who finish the Shadows of Amn campaign before the finale at the stronghold. </p>

      <p><strong>Max HP at Level One</strong><br />
        <em>All games</em></p>
      <p>A common house rule for pen-and-paper games, this component will ensure a maximum HP roll for at level one for all characters, e.g. mages get four hit points. It can be used in conjunction with all options in the next component, Higher HP on Level Up.</p>
      <p><strong>Higher HP on Level Up</strong><br />
        <em>All games</em></p>
      <p> This component provides the player with a choice of four options that will
        alter HP rolls when characters
        level up. The component will not affect HPs on level ups when the character has moved beyond die rolls. All of these changes are independent of HP bonuses from constitution or other sources. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Maximum - This option will ensure that the dice roll will always be the
          highest available.</li>
        <li>NWN-style - This option
          will ensure that the range of possible HPs gained
          will always be in the higher half of the range, i.e. results will always
          be 4-6 on 1d6, 5-8
          for 1d8, etc.</li>
        <li>Average - The rolls will always be the average of the die roll, e.g. 3 or 4 for d6 rolls, 6 or 7 for d12. The component will alternate rounding up and down for successive levels to keep in the average band.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>Be warned: without an Enhanced Edition game or TobEx, barbarian characters will interact badly with this
        component</em> due to their hardcoded nature. </p>
      <p><strong>Allow HP Rolls Through Level 20 (Angel)</strong><br />
      <em>All games except IWD2</em></p>
      <p>Most classes shift from a HP roll to a fixed (and lower) amount of HP per level around level 9 or 10. This cmponent will allow HP rolls to continue through level 20. </p>
      <p><strong>Maximum HP Creatures (the
        bigg)</strong> <br />
        <em>All games</em></p>
      <p> This component, based on code from the bigg, will alter creatures to have
        their theoretical maximum hit points. Creatures will get either a hit point
        total based on maximum hit dice rolls appropriate to their level, or their
        current hit point total--whichever is higher. The user has three choices
        with this component: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>All creatures</li>
        <li>Joinable NPCs only (cheating
          version of this component)</li>
        <li>Non-Joinable NPCs only
          (difficulty increasing version of this component)</li>
      </ul>
      <p> If the game can't have joinable NPCs (IWD, IWD2) only the first option is available. </p>
      <p><strong>Identify All Items</strong><br />
        <em>All games</em></p>
      <p> Annoyed with having to identify items all the time? Now you don't have to.
        This component will affect <em>all</em> items in the game, including items
        introduced by mods, save one: an item from Shadows of Soubar will remain
        unidentified, as a quest revolves around it being unidentified. </p>
      <p><strong>Easy Spell Learning <br />
        </strong> <em>All games</em></p>
      <p> This component makes it easier for arcane spellcasters to scribe scrolls
        to their spellbook. The player has a choice between two implementations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>100% Learn Spells. Scribing scrolls is always successful.</li>
        <li>100% Learn Spells and unlimited spells per level. In addition to the
          above, this implementation removes the limits on the maximum number of
          spells learned per level. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Bottomless Bags of Holding</strong><br />
        <em>BGEE, BG2EE, IWDEE, EET,  BG2, IWD (requires HoW), IWD2,  BGT, Tutu, IWD-in-BG2, PsTEE</em></p>
      <p> This component will alter every bag of holding to have unlimited capacity.
        Scroll cases, ammo belts, gem bags and the regular bags of holding will
        be changed. This component will not affect what you can place in the bags,
        just the capacity. This component will affect <em>all</em> items in the
        game, including items introduced by mods. Please note that every time a
        script checks for an item, it'll have to parse everything you're carrying,
        so keep this in mind if you begin to experience slowdowns when carrying
        a lot of items. . </p>
      <p><strong>Remove Fatigue from Restoration Spells</strong><br />
        <em>BGEE, BG2EE, IWDEE, EET,  BG2,    BGT,  IWD-in-BG2</em></p>
      <p> This component removes the fatigue that occurs when a character casts a Lesser
        or Greater Restoration spell. </p>
      <p><strong>Shut Up &quot;You Must Gather Your Party ...&quot; (Weimer)</strong> <br />
        <em>BGEE, BG2EE,  EET, BG, BG2,    BGT, Tutu, IWD-in-BG2</em></p>
      <p> Disables the sound file played when you try to move less than a full party
        into or out of a party-required area. </p>
      <p> <strong>Change Effect of Reputation on Store Prices</strong><br />
        <em>All games</em></p>
      <p> Your reputation affects the prices of stores throughout the game; notably prices go down as reputation goes up and this component offers ways to change the mechanic. The original variant, Low Reputation Store Discount (Sabre, Richardson,
        Weimer),
        is unchanged: reputation values of 8-13 result in no discounts; items are
        sold at their original prices. Every point lower or higher than 8 or 13,
        respectively, gives the party a 5% discount. This reaches a maximum of 35%
        -- meaning that the party will only pay 65% of the item's original price
        -- at reputation values of 1 and 20.</p>
      <p>Three new variants, courtesy of Luiz, remove the effect of reputation on
        storekeepers outright. The resulting prices can be set to 60%, 80%, or 100%
        of their listed values in general, but note that storekeepers will retain
        their original markups and buy discounts. </p>
      <p><strong>Increase Ammo Stack Size</strong><br />
        <em>All games</em></p>
      <p> This tweak will adjust the maximum number of ammo--bullets, arrows, bolts,
        darts, throwing axes, throwing hammers, and throwing daggers--in a stack to  40, 80, 120, or unlimited (999). This component
        will affect <em>all</em> items in the game, including items introduced
        by mods. </p>
      <p><strong>Increase Jewelry, Gem, and Miscellaneous Item Stacks</strong> (previously known as 
          <strong>Increase Jewelry and Gem Stacks</strong>)<br />
        <em>All games</em></p>
      <p> This tweak will adjust the maximum number of gems and jewelry in a stack
        to  40, 80, 120, or unlimited (999). This component will <em>not</em> affect magical rings or amulets.
        Bandit scalps, ankheg shells, winter wolf pelts, and a few other miscellaneous items will also be affected by this component. This component will
        affect <em>all</em> items in the game, including items introduced by mods. </p>
      <p><strong>Increase Potion Stacking</strong><br />
        <em>All games</em></p>
      <p> This tweak will adjust the maximum number of potions in a stack to  40, 80, 120, or unlimited (999).
        This component will affect <em>all</em> items in the game, including items
        introduced by mods. </p>
      <p><strong>Increase Scroll Stacking</strong><br />
        <em>All games</em></p>
      <p> This tweak will adjust the maximum number of scrolls in a stack to  40, 80, 120, or unlimited (999).
        This component will affect <em>all</em> items in the game, including items
        introduced by mods. </p>
      <p><strong>Happy Patch </strong><br />
        <em>BGEE, BG2EE, IWDEE, EET, BG, BG2,    BGT, Tutu, IWD-in-BG2</em></p>
      <p> This provides many options for party unity. First, the player can control party complaints through one of three options:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>NPCs never get angry about reputation</li>
        <li>NPCs get angry, but never leave</li>
        <li>NPCs remain neutral, never getting happy or angry</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Please note that installing Virtue with this component will essentially
        nullify it. Virtue changes reputation checks to check Virtue instead, so
        this component will be changed to prevent your party members leaving due
        to Virtue--but the kicker is that they'll now leave due to reputation. </p>
      <p><strong>NPCs Don't Fight</strong><br />
        <em>BGEE, BG2EE,  EET, BG, BG2,    BGT, Tutu</em></p>
      <p> At certain points, stock BG/BG2 characters will get fed up with another and start fights, only ending when one or more of them are dead. This component will simply prevent the fights from starting. </p>
      <p><strong>Prevent Aerie-Haer'Dalis Romance</strong><br />
        <em> BG2EE,  EET,  BG2,    BGT</em></p>
      <p> This component will prevent the Aerie-Haer'Dalis romance from starting. </p>
      <p><strong>Neutral Characters Make Happy Comments at Mid-Range Reputation (Luiz) </strong><br />
        <em>BGEE, BG2EE, IWDEE, EET, BG, BG2,    BGT, Tutu, IWD-in-BG2</em></p>
      <p> Every joinable NPC has lines
        they say when they're happy, ambivalent, or upset about the party's reputation.
        In the original tables, neutral characters could never be happy--even at
        mid-range reputation values, they would remain ambivalent. This component
        alters the reputation table so that they are now happy at middle of the road
        values, so you can now hear lines from neutral NPCs which
        were previously not available. This component is completely compatible with
        any variant of the Happy Patch.</p>
      <p>Please note that installing Virtue with this component will essentially
        nullify it. </p>
      <p> <strong>No Traps or Locks (Weimer)</strong><br />
        <em>All games</em></p>
      <p> All floor traps that can be disarmed are removed from the game. All door
        and container traps are removed from the game. All locked doors and containers
        have their lockpick difficulty set to 0 (they can be bashed open by anyone
        in one blow) unless they require a key. All hidden doors have their detect difficulty set to 0 (anyone
        will detect them by standing around long enough). &quot;Special&quot; traps
        remain. Note that since the traps are gone entirely you cannot get XP by
        disarming them. </p>
      <p><strong>Faster Chapter 1&amp;2 Cut-Scenes &amp; Dreams (Karzak, Blucher,
        aVENGER, Weimer) </strong><br />
        <em> BG2EE,  EET,  BG2, BGT</em></p>
      <p> If you're replaying the game for the Nth time, this component saves precious
        minutes. In general this skips or shortens cut-scenes and dream sequences.
        You can also speed up your first encounter with Gaelan Bayle by saying (3) &quot;Yes,
        show me to your home.&quot; and then (5) &quot;Very well, I'll be back with
        the money.&quot;</p>
      <p>There are two options for this component: the original cutscenes from the
        Ease of Use mod, and a non-silly version. The originals featured lines which
        really broke the fourth wall, such as the PC using
        lines from Neeber and Irenicus and Imoen leaving happily together after the
        party escaped to the Promenade. </p>
      <p><strong>Invisible Cloak of Mirroring</strong> <br />
        <em> BG2EE, IWDEE, EET,  BG2,    BGT,  IWD-in-BG2</em></p>
      <p> This turns off that huge glowing white wiffle ball animation for the ToB Cloak
        of Mirroring, but will leave intact the animations for Spell Trap spell as well as the glowing disc for physical
        mirror effects (e.g. Balduran's Shield, Shield of Reflection). </p>
      <p><strong>Keep Drizzt's Loot, Disable Malchor Harpell (Weimer)</strong> <br />
        <em> BG2EE,  EET,  BG2,    BGT</em></p>
      <p> If you kill Drizzt and take his stuff, Malchor Harpell appears and takes
        it back. This would make more sense in the original Baldur's Gate where
        his loot was actually powerful. By that point in SoA,
        Drizzt's loot is mostly worthless and Malchor feels heavy-handed and out
        of place. </p>
      <p><strong>No Drow Avatars on Party In Underdark (Weimer)</strong> <br />
        <em>BG2EE,  EET,  BG2,    BGT</em></p>
      <p>Adalon the Silver Dragon normally changes the party to look like drow cosmetically.
        Unfortunately, the game engine has a number of bugs related to this that
        cause the PCs to &quot;stutter&quot; and &quot;stop
        walking&quot; and whatnot (especially if they have regeneration items). This
        disables the cosmetic drow avatar bit only: the plot remains unchanged. </p>
      <p><strong>Disable Romances</strong> <br />
        <em> BG2EE,  EET,  BG2, BGT</em></p>
      <p> This component will prevent the original BioWare/Beamdog romances from starting in BG2(EE). Mod romances will not be affected.</p>
      <p><strong>Accelerate/Decelerate Romances</strong> <br />
        <em> BG2EE,  EET,  BG2, BGT; skipped if Disable Romances is installed</em></p>
      <p> This component will adjust the wait time between romance banters (aka love talks) for  the original BioWare/Beamdog romances; mod romances are not affected. This will help the player adjust the length of the romance track to their play style. The speed can be adjusted faster or slower by a factor of 5 (20% to 500% of the default timers). Note that this will only affect the timers, not any other special conditions (such as resting, being outside, etc.) that may be required for the romance track to progress. </p>
      <p><strong>Romance Cheats (Sabre, Richardson, Weimer)</strong> <br />
      <em>BG2EE,  EET,  BG2, BGT; skipped if Disable Romances is installed</em></p>
      <p> This component allows greater flexibility with the original BioWare/Beamdog romances.
        Please note that the multi-romance option may cause stuttering when used
        in conjunction with a third-party mod romance. The player can choose five
        parameters:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>No gender requirements (i.e. Aerie romances females) </li>
        <li>No racial requirements (i.e. Anomen will romance a half-orc)</li>
        <li>Multiple romances </li>
        <li>Nothing kills romance (requires multiple romances)</li>
        <li> Start romances for new games in ToB </li>
      </ul>
      <p>These should provide 24 different variants of the romance options (12 for
        non-ToB games). The 'Start romances
        for new games in ToB' option is
        based, in part, upon the <a href="http://www.pocketplane.net/npcflirt/">NPC Flirt
        Pack</a>'s version of same (and used with permission), but will also work
        in conjunction with the removal of gender and racial requirements and multiple
        romances. If all you're looking for is to start romances for new ToB games,
        use the Flirt Pack instead, as they provide a much more expansive treatment. </p>
      <p><strong>Rest Anywhere</strong><br />
        <em>All games</em></p>
      <p> This component allows you to rest in any area. Inns and outdoor campsites      are no longer required. You can still be interrupted by monsters or guards; see the next two components if you wish to adjust those as well. </p>
      <p><strong>Disable Non-Hostile Rest Spawns</strong><br />
        <em>All games</em></p>
      <p>This component will disable non-hostile creatures spawning when you try to rest, such as a guard in town trying to stop you from sleeping in the street. </p>
      <p><strong>Alter Hostile Rest Spawns</strong><br />
        <em>All games</em></p>
      <p>This component will allow you to alter the frequency of hostile spawns when you try to sleep, e.g. monsters attacking when you try to rest. You can disable them completely, or adjust the frequency up or down: decrease 50%, increase 50%, double frequency, or quadruple frequency. </p>
      <p><strong>Sellable Items (icelus)</strong><br />
        <em>All games</em></p>
      <p> Originally, this component made previously unsellable staves, clubs, and
        slings sellable for a single gold piece as well as restoring the Root of
        the Problem club to its original selling price from BG.
        It's been expanded to include other unsellable items, as well as introducing
        a store tweak: stores which buy arrows now buy bolts as well. </p>
      <p><strong>Stores Purchase All Item Types</strong><br />
        <em>All games</em></p>
      <p>This component will modify merchants and stores to purchase all item types; e.g. Galoomp the Bookkeeper in BG2 will now purchase armor, Oswald in IWD will purchase more than just potions, etc. This especially helps in places like BG's Beregost or IWD's Kuldahar, where you have to cross the map repeatedly to visit multiple merchants to sell  your latest loot. Some stores, such as Officer Vai, may have special markups to buy/sell items very close to their actual values. These stores are ignored by this component to avoid creating an exploitable, infinite-money cheat for high reputation/high charisma characters. </p>
      <p> <strong>Minimum Stats Cheat </strong><br />
        <em>All games except IWD, PsT, PsTEE</em></p>
      <p> This component will let you set  individual minimum stats for all classes
        and kits. Minimum stats are a drawback in P&amp;P,
        but in IE games it will simply re-roll a stat until it meets the minimum--essentially an unnatural
        boost to your dice rolls at character creation. This component will allow
        you to select a minimum stat value between 6 and 15 for each of the six stats individually (including no change). Note that at higher
        minimums, your flexibility in re-distributing the points can become more
        and more limited. Play around with the range to find minimums that work
        for you. </p>
      <p><strong>Sensible Entrance Points</strong><br />
        <em>BG, BG2,    BGT, Tutu</em></p>
      <p> This component modifies a number of areas with suboptimal entrance points, e.g. when entering Beregost from the east in a BGT/EET/Tutu/BGEE game the player will now enter closer to the Thunderhammer Smithy. For now most of the changes are on the BG side--BGT only gets the aforementioned <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/index.php?app=gallery&amp;image=500">Beregost change</a> while the other BG platforms also get changes to the<a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/gallery/image/498-sensible-entrance-points-bg-zombie-farm-map/"> zombie farm</a>, <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/gallery/image/499-sensible-entrance-points-bg-farm-map-north-of-friendly-arm-inn/">farm north of FAI</a>, <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/gallery/image/497-sensible-entrance-points-bg-shipwreck-map/">shipwreck</a> and <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/gallery/image/496-sensible-entrance-points-bg-lighthouse-map/">lighthouse</a> areas. One big change for BG2 content is a <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/gallery/image/501-sensible-entrance-points-bg2-noble-order-of-the-radiant-heart-map/">flipped interior map of the Noble Order of the Radiant Heart</a> (this is already standard in BG2EE). </p>
      <p><strong>Taerom Makes Additional Ankheg Armors (Icendoan/grogerson)</strong><br />
        <em>BGEE,   EET, BG, BG2, BGT, Tutu</em></p>
      <p> In the standard game, the smith Taerom will buy all the ankheg shells the party      has at one time, and will make only one set of Ankheg Armor. After it is completed,      he will not even buy ankheg shells. This tweak changes this. He will now buy one      shell at a time, and will again buy shells and make additional armor once the first      is completed. Cost and time requirements still apply, and he can only make one       at a time. Fenten in Baldur's Gate will also buy shells one at a time. </p>
      <p><strong>Friendly Random Drops</strong><br />
        <em>IWDEE, IWD, IWD-in-BG2</em></p>
      <p> One of IWD's more fun aspects   can also be one of its most frustrating: random drops. Various chests   and creatures will pick an item from a list of possibilities   once you   enter their area, making certain powerful and unusual items unavailable   in a given game--a common frustration is missing elven chain mail for   bards. This component gives players some control over this process by   letting them select from one of three options:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Re-Randomize on Reload - This option simply re-picks the random   item whenever you reload or revisit an area, so you can stand beside a   chest and mash quickload. </li>
        <li>Choose Your Drop - The random items are replaced with tokens,   which can be immediately exchanged for your choice of an item from the   original table. </li>
        <li>Exchange with Merchants - This component will have the normal   random drops when you travel through the world, but adds a merchant in   Kuldahar and one in Lonelywood (if HoW is installed). These merchants will allow you to exchange your items   for another item in the table--for a commission, of course.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Never Lose Access to Orrick the Grey's Trade Goods<br />
        </strong><em> IWD, IWD-in-BG2</em></p>
      <p>This component allows you to ask Orrick to show you his earlier goods, once he's moved on to offering you higher-quality stuff. This functionality is built into IWDEE by default. </p>
      <p><strong>Recoverable Ammunition (argent77)</strong><br />
        <em>BGEE, BG2EE, IWDEE, EET, BG (requires TotSC), BG2, BGT, Tutu, IWD-in-BG2</em></p>
      <p> This tweak allows you to recover some or all unenchanted ammunition   after being shot, which includes arrows, bullets and bolts without   additional hit effects. For example, normal arrows are included, but   Arrows of Slaying are not. The following options are available:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>25% chance to recover after a successful hit</li>
        <li>50% chance to recover after a successful hit</li>
        <li>75% chance to recover after a successful hit</li>
        <li>100% chance to recover after a successful hit</li>
        <li>25% chance to recover after a successful hit, vs. enemies only</li>
        <li>50% chance to recover after a successful hit, vs. enemies only</li>
        <li>75% chance to recover after a successful hit, vs. enemies only</li>
        <li>100% chance to recover after a successful hit, vs. enemies only</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Options containing &quot;vs. enemies only&quot; will only be recoverable when firing at hostile creatures.</p>
      <p><strong>Recoverable Throwing Weapons</strong> <strong>(argent77)</strong><br />
        <em>BGEE, BG2EE, IWDEE, EET, BG (requires TotSC), BG2, BGT, Tutu, IWD-in-BG2</em></p>
      <p> This tweak allows you to recover some or all unenchanted throwing   weapons after being thrown, which includes but is not limited to axes,   daggers and darts without additional hit effects. For example, normal   darts are included, but Darts of Wounding are not. The following options   are available:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>25% chance to recover after a successful hit</li>
        <li>50% chance to recover after a successful hit</li>
        <li>75% chance to recover after a successful hit</li>
        <li>100% chance to recover after a successful hit</li>
        <li>25% chance to recover after a successful hit, vs. enemies only</li>
        <li>50% chance to recover after a successful hit, vs. enemies only</li>
        <li>75% chance to recover after a successful hit, vs. enemies only</li>
        <li>100% chance to recover after a successful hit, vs. enemies only</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Options containing &quot;vs. enemies only&quot; will only be recoverable when firing at hostile creatures</p>
      <p><strong>Give Every Class/Kit Four Weapon Slots</strong><br />
        <em>BGEE, BG2EE, IWDEE, EET</em></p>
      <p>This component will give every class/kit four weapon slots, like fighters receive. This component is available to vanilla BG2 games via TobEx. </p>
      <p><strong>Personalize Automatic Save Names</strong><br />
        <em>All Enhanced Edition games, patched to 2.0 or higher</em>      </p>
      <p>This tweak adds the name of the protagonist to all your saved games that are automatically made by the game (such as autosave, quicksave or chapter saves). That way you can play with different party setups without the danger of your old saves being overwritten (provided the protagonist uses different names).</p>
      <p><strong>Death Cam</strong><br />
        <em>BGEE, BG2EE,  EET</em></p>
      <p>Sometimes in the chaos of battle, you can lose track of the main character and get surprised with the game over screen. This component will give you a chance to view the feedback window by jumping to the main character when he dies, and giving you a full round--six seconds--to view the combat log (including the ability to pause) before the game over screen plays. </p>
      <p><strong>Start New Games with Party AI Turned Off</strong><br />
        <em>All games except PsT</em></p>
      <p>This component simply turns off the 'Party AI' button for new games. You can still enable it by clicking it. </p>
      <p><strong>No Depreciation in Stores</strong><br />
        <em>All games</em></p>
      <p>As you sell items to a merchant, they will start to offer less to buy items they already possess. This component will disable this process, so that they will offer the same amount for the first short sword as the 100th you sell. </p>
      <p><strong>Make party members less likely to die irreversibly</strong><br />
      <em>BGEE,   BG2EE, EET,   BG2, BGT, Tutu</em></p>
      <p>This component tries to prevent &quot;chunking&quot;, the annoying permanent death of your          character when you're reduced below -10 <acronym title="Hit Points">hp</acronym>.          Characters who get reduced to 0 <acronym title="Hit Points">hp</acronym> or          below just die in the usual fashion and can be resurrected. It   isn't possible          to prevent quite all forms of chunking (massive damage from   fire, in particular, still seems to cause chunking fairly reliably), but   this component should make it          a rarer occurrence. This may be useful in the later stages of   the game,          when melee opponents often do 30-40 <acronym title="Hit Points">hp</acronym> damage          per blow - that 10 <acronym title="Hit Points">hp</acronym> safety margin          starts to feel slender. </p>

      <p>Components in this category directly affect joinable NPCs. </p>
      <p><strong>Adjust Evil Joinable NPC Reactions</strong><br />
        <em>BGEE,   EET, BG,  BGT, Tutu</em></p>
      <p> In Baldur's Gate, most NPCs use
        reaction rolls to determine their dialogue with the PC.
        Reactions rolls are d20 plus adjustments
        for charisma and party reputation. The problem is that the PC can
        get low rolls and evil joinable NPCs may
        refuse to join the party as a result--for evil NPCs this
        doesn't make a lot of sense, as a low-reputation party is probably what they
        would prefer. This component adjusts the reaction rolls of evil-aligned joinable NPCs to
        be more favorable. This doesn't mean that Viconia still won't leave without
        joining, but it makes it less likely. </p>
      <p><strong>Improved Fate Spirit Summoning</strong><br />
        <em> BG2EE,  EET,  BG2 (requires ToB), BGT</em></p>
      <p> This component aims to make the Fate Spirit summoning a bit more consistent
        within the game world. An extra condition is added for summoning NPCs from
        the Fate Spirit in the pocket plane: you must have met them sometime in your
        travels in the Shadows of Amn portion of the game. If you never meet Mazzy,
        for example, you will not have the option to summon her. Like the existing
        Yoshimo option, the Fate Spirit will now comment appropriately if an NPC is
        dead and beyond its reach. This component will not affect games started in
        Throne of Bhaal, only games where you are continuing from the end of Shadows
        of Amn. This component applies to most (hopefully all) mod NPCs, but if you find one that is not covered please let us know in the Tweaks forums. </p>
      <p><strong>ToB-Style NPCs</strong><br />
        <em>BGEE, BG2EE, IWDEE, EET, BG, BG2,    BGT, Tutu, IWD-in-BG2</em></p>
      <p> This component will alter all joinable NPCs to
        join in the same fashion as Throne of Bhaal, where NPCs immediately
        level-up upon joining, with a caveat: all creature files are moved down to
        their lowest experience version, so if you pick up an NPC early
        enough they will not level upon joining. However, later in the game they
        will, allowing you to select weapon proficiencies, thieving points, and other
        goodies from the level-up process.</p>
      <p><strong>Allow BG <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> pairs to separate</strong><br />
      <em>BGEE,   EET, BG,  BGT, Tutu</em></p>
      <p>One of the more frustrating aspects of <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> is that many of the more interesting <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> come in inseparable pairs (Khalid          and Jaheira, Minsc and Dynaheir, etc.) Of course, it's always possible to          get round this by leaving one member of a pair in a building or getting them          killed, but it does spoil the suspension of disbelief a bit.</p>
      <p>This component allows you to separate the pairs. If you kick one member          of a pair out of the party, then the other still leaves - but if you speak          to one member of a pair and invite them to join up, you get a dialogue option          to take them but not their partner.      </p>
      <p><strong>Consistent Stats: Edwin </strong><br />
        <em>BGEE, BG2EE,  EET, BG, BG2, BGT, Tutu</em></p>
      <p> A number of joinable NPCs that
        are in Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate II have slightly different stats in
        both games. This component allows the player to use either the BG or BG2 stats
        for Edwin for a consistent experience. The changes will only show up in your
        game if you have not met Edwin yet. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use BG stats - gives Edwin 9
          Strength and 9 Wisdom, as he has in BG</li>
        <li>Use BG2 stats - gives Edwin
          10 Strength and 10 Wisdom, as he has in BG2</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Consistent Stats: Jaheira </strong><br />
        <em>BGEE, BG2EE,  EET, BG, BG2, BGT, Tutu</em></p>
      <p> A number of joinable NPCs that
        are in Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate II have slightly different stats in
        both games. This component allows the player to use either the BG or BG2 stats
        for Jaheira for a consistent experience. The changes will only show up in
        your game if you have not met Jaheira yet. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use BG stats - gives Jaheira
          14 Dexterity, as she has in BG</li>
        <li>Use BG2 stats - gives Jaheira
          17 Dexterity, as she has in BG2</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Change Jaheira to Neutral Good Alignment </strong><br />
        <em>BGEE, BG2EE,  EET, BG, BG2, BGT, Tutu</em></p>
      <p> A player request, this component brings Jaheira's alignment to Neutral Good
        to better reflect her actions and attitude ingame. The changes will only
        show up in your game if you have not met Jaheira yet. </p>
      <p><strong>Consistent Stats: Minsc </strong><br />
        <em>BGEE, BG2EE,  EET, BG, BG2, BGT, Tutu</em></p>
      <p> A number of joinable NPCs that
        are in Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate II have slightly different stats in
        both games. This component allows the player to use either the BG or BG2 stats
        for Minsc for a consistent experience. The changes will only show up in your
        game if you have not met Minsc yet. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use BG stats - gives Minsc 15
          Dexterity and 15 Constitution, as he has in BG</li>
        <li>Use BG2 stats - gives Minsc
          16 Dexterity and 16 Constitution, as he has in BG2</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Consistent Stats: Viconia </strong><br />
        <em>BGEE, BG2EE,  EET, BG, BG2, BGT, Tutu</em></p>
      <p> A number of joinable NPCs that
        are in Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate II have slightly different stats in
        both games. This component allows the player to use either the BG or BG2 stats
        for Viconia for a consistent experience. The changes will only show up in
        your game if you have not met Viconia yet. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use BG stats - gives Viconia
          15 Wisdom and 50% magic resistance, as she has in BG</li>
        <li>Use BG2 stats - gives Viconia
          18 Wisdom and 65% magic resistance, as she has in BG2</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Make Khalid a Fighter-Mage (Domi) </strong><br />
        <em>BGEE,   EET, BG,  BGT, Tutu</em></p>
      <p> This component will change Khalid into a multi-classed fighter-mage, and
        includes a short dialogue. The changes will only show up in your game if
        you have not met Khalid yet. </p>
      <p><strong>Make Montaron an Assassin (Andyr)</strong><br />
        <em>BGEE,   EET,   BGT, Tutu</em></p>
      <p>This component changes Montaron into an Assassin. The changes will only show
        up in your game if you have not met Montaron yet. </p>
      <p><strong>Change Korgan to Neutral Evil Alignment </strong><br />
        <em> BG2EE,  EET,  BG2, BGT</em></p>
      <p>A player request, this component alters Korgan's alignment to Neutral Evil
        to better reflect his actions and attitude ingame. The changes will only
        show up in your game if you have not met Korgan yet. </p>
      <p><strong>Give Kagain A Legal Constitution Score of 19</strong><br />
        <em>BGEE,   EET, BG, BGT, Tutu</em></p>
      <p> Just as the title implies, this component will lower Kagain's constitution
        from his current value of 20 to the dwarven maximum of 19. The changes will
        only show up in your game if you have not met Kagain yet. </p>
      <p><strong>Give Coran A Legal Dexterity Score of 19</strong><br />
        <em>BGEE,   EET, BG, BGT, Tutu</em></p>
      <p> Just as the title implies, this component will lower Coran's dexterity      from his current value of 20 to the elven maximum of 19. The changes will      only show up in your game if you have not met Coran yet. </p>
      <p><strong>Make Xan a Generalist Mage (Mike1072)</strong><br />
        <em>BGEE,   EET, BG, BGT, Tutu</em></p>
      <p> This depressed elf mage has the lowest constitution in the game, giving him      low survivability. Add to this a general lack of strong attack      spells as an enchanter. Inspired by Kulyok's Xan mods for both BG and BG2,      this mod makes Xan the only straight generalist mage in the game. This gives      him access to all mage spells in the game to help offset his overall weakness.      There is a trade-off, however, since he will not have the extra spells given      to the specialist mages.</p>
      <p><strong>Move Boo out of quick access and into Minsc's pack</strong><br />
        <em>BGEE, BG2EE,  EET, BG, BG2, BGT, Tutu</em></p>
      <p>I love Boo, really I do, but it's infuriating that he eats up   one of Minsc's          quickslots. This patch just moves him into a slot in Minsc's   backpack. It will only work if you start a new game (or, for BG, at   least install before arriving at Nashkel).      </p>
      <p><strong>Allow Yeslick to use axes</strong><br />
        <em>BGEE,   EET, BG,  BGT, Tutu</em></p>
      <p>It seems appropriate that Yeslick, who is a dwarven fighter-cleric, ought          to be able to use the traditional dwarven weapon; this component allows him          to.</p>
      <p>(There is a loophole here: due to the way the game engine works, this actually          allows all fighter-clerics (not just Yeslick) to use axes. Yeslick is actually          the only <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> fighter-cleric          in the core game but it might affect third-party <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym>, or your primary character (and,          for <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym> users, it will affect          Anomen). If you want to take advantage of this then be my guest, but it wasn't          the intended function of the component.)</p>
      <p><strong>Ensure Shar-Teel doesn't die in the original challenge</strong><br />
        <em>BGEE,   EET, BG,  BGT, Tutu</em></p>
      <p> Shar-Teel is rather fragile: it's easy to kill her by mistake in the battle          where you recruit her. This component guarantees that she survives the battle.  </p>
      <p><strong>Don't Auto-Assign Advanced AI Scripting to Party</strong><br />
        <em>BGEE,   BG2EE, EET</em></p>
      <p> Party members automatically get assigned the 'Advanced AI' script in BGEE/BG2EE. This component alters the NPCs to instead come with the &quot;DEFAULT&quot; AI script assigned, which does nothing, as they do in vanilla BG/BG2 games. </p>

      <p>This mod originally started when CamDawg and Idobek decided to combine their small tweak packs into a single mod, christened the G3 Tweak Pack and hosted at the (then brand-new) Gibberlings Three modding community. As Baldur's Gate Tutu gained in popularity, the G3 Tweak Pack was spun off into the Tutu Tweak Pack. As modding tools became more advanced and as conversion projects began to overlap the G3 and Tutu Tweak Packs were recombined and, with the permission of Wes Weimer, included the Ease-of-Use mod. This effort resulted in the BG2 Tweak Pack. Once again, demand caused several spin off mods--the IWD Tweak Pack, the IWD Fixpack, the IWD2 Tweak Pack, the PsT Tweak Pack,  the BG1 Tweak Pack, and the IWD-in-BG2 combo fixpack/tweak pack. Once again, technology has caught up, and all of these individual projects are once again being discontinued individually (save the IWD FIxpack) and combined--hopefully for good this time--into a monolithic mod, the Tweaks Anthology. </p>
      <p>With such a convoluted history, we nonetheless strive to try and thank and acknowledge all those who contributed along the way and apologize profusely if we've missed anyone. </p>
      <p>First, a big thanks to the wonderful community at <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/">The
        Gibberlings Three</a>. Many of the ideas leading to various components
        were suggested and/or improved by community involvement, and we hope to
        continue this collaboration. </p>
      <p>Big thanks to Wes Weimer, who gave us permission to incorporate Ease of
        Use. Ease of Use has many authors and contributors, and I have endeavored
        to credit them appropriately--if we've overlooked someone or mis-credited
        their work, please let us know. In addition to Wes, Gebhard Blucher, Kevin
        Dorner (Baldurdash), jcompton, Schumacher, Kalthorine Ut Wistan, Karzak,
        Fred S. Richardson, and Sabre contributed to the old Ease of Use pack; translators
        for EoU were Antonio Favata, Thot,
        Bhasbuto of <a href="http://www.clandlan.net/">Clan DLAN</a>, and Marco Ivezic.</p>
      <p>Thanks to the authors that originally spun off the BG2 Tweaks into a multitude of other platforms,  made new components, and improvements to the old--all of which have found their way back into the Anthology. grogerson authored the BG1 Tweak Pack; Andyr authored both the PsT and IWD Tweak Packs, and the bigg wrote the IWD2 Tweak Pack. DavidW, as part of the IWD-in-BG2 project, also produced the supplemental mod IWD-in-BG2 Fixpack/Tweak Pack, most of which has been absorbed here. </p>
      <p>Andyr was also kind enough to provide the Icewind Dale spell casting graphics
        and the Make Montaron an Assassin component. Thanks to the bigg, who provided
        the coding for the Maximum HP For Non-Party-Joinable
        Creatures (now Maximum HP Creatures)
        component. Thanks to icelus who provided code for Sellable Staffs, Clubs,
        and Slings (now Sellable Items). Thanks to Galactygon for the code for the
        Change Avatar When Wearing Robes or Armor component. Thanks to Domi for the
        Make Khalid a Fighter-Mage component. Thanks for Luiz for donating his Neutral
        Characters Make Happy Comments at Mid-Range Reputation and Change Effect
        of Reputation on Store Prices components. Thanks to Salk and Anomaly for
        variants of the Happy Patch. Thanks to Ardanis/GeN1e for the Trap Cap Removal,
        Remove Delay for Magical Traps, and Remove Summoning Cap for Celestials components.
        Thanks to jcompton for letting me scavenge the dialogue coding of <a href="http://www.pocketplane.net/npcflirt/">NPC Flirt
        Pack</a> for the Romance Cheats component. Thanks to argent77 for the Recoverable ammunition and Recoverable throwing weapons components. </p>
      <p>Originally from the BG1 Tweak Pack, a big thanks to Zed Nocear for his AreaCheck emulation, Portable Containers, Breakable Non-Magic      Iron Armor, Shields and Helms, and the coding improvements for Send BioWare NPCs to an Inn      and Send Multi-Player NPCs to an Inn. Thanks to plainab for providing his WIPT program      for Make Magic Shields Glow, the streamlined code for the Friendly Arm Inn Container Restoration,      and Change Cloakwood Mine Chapter End Trigger.</p>
      <p>From the IWD Tweak Pack, a huge thank you for grogerson for his assistance, playtesting, bug reports,      and suggestions, particularly for the second generation of this mod (v5 and      above). Thanks also to Daulmakan and the various unnamed guests who helped      report bugs and other issues. Thanks to the folks at G3 who      contributed ideas for the various components. Thanks to icelus for   contributing      a few components, and Kaelas for the Talon of the Gloomfrost fix.   Cheers      to Petor23 and Da_Venom for help testing! Thanks also to guest Mike,   grogerson, and Zed Nocear for insight into  issues with the Wear   Multiple Protection Items (P&amp;P Style) component.</p>
      <p>Unique Containers was originally a standalone mini-mod by Miloch. Thanks for that project go to DavidNowlin for the original idea and testing; Bursk, pro5 and SixOfSpades for troubleshooting; Aramis            and Vedran for the Lost Items mod; Graoumf for the French translation, Leomar for the German translation; Stoneangel            and Andrea/ilot for the Italian translation; prowler            and aerie.ru for the Russian translation; and Ancalagon            el Negro and Immortality for the Spanish translation. </p>
      <p>Versions 7-10 of BG2 Tweaks owe a lot to the community who picked it up and made several updates: DavidW, Mike1072, berelinde, Wisp, and aVENGER.</p>
      <p>Thanks to the folks at G3 who
        contributed ideas for the various components. Thank you as well to our translators:</p>

      <p><strong>Version 8 - January 13, 2019</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Move NPCs to Convenient Locations</strong> would fail to move Eldoth on BGT installs; Shar-Teel would get moved to the right area with wrong coordinates on non-BGT installs</li>
        <li>Deprecated <strong>Stackable ankheg shells, winterwolf pelts and wyvern heads</strong> as these items already get covered as part of the <strong>Increase Jewelry, Gem, and Miscellaneous Item Stacks</strong> 
          (previously known as 
          <strong>Increase Jewelry and Gem Stacks</strong>)        </li>
        <li>The algorithm for <strong>No Traps or Locks</strong> has been refined a bit as it was missing some trapped containers. It will also no longer remove locks for doors or containers which require a key. </li>
        <li>BGEE already has the changes from <strong>Sensible Entrance Points</strong> by default, so it will now get correctly skippped for BGEE and EET games</li>
        <li><strong>Make party members less likely to die irreversibly</strong> requires some functionality only found in BG2 and EE games, and is now restricted as such</li>
        <li><strong>BG NPCs go to inns</strong> was being restricted on BG games in the Gnoll Stronghold; you can now send party members to inns from the Gnoll Strnghold as you would in BGEE/Tutu/BGT/EET</li>
        <li><strong>BG NPCs go to inns</strong> was also failing for some NPCs on EET games as it was patching their BG2 parting dialogues instead of their BG parting dialogues</li>
        <li><strong>Allow Yeslick to use axes</strong> could fail on BG installs as it tried to patch a BG2 file without checking</li>
        <li>Fixed bug where some of the imported SCS components (such as <strong>BG NPCs go to inns</strong>) would fail due to a missing directory</li>
        <li>The use of the variable library for BG/BGEE/Tutu/BGT/EET has been centralized.</li>
        <li>Updated Italian translation</li>
        <li>Fixed bug with <strong>Alter Weapon Proficiency System</strong>, specifically, the BG variants, where axes could end up with descriptions that listed the  proficiency type for the item as &quot;new_weap&quot; or a wrong proficiency. The error was purely cosmetic and did not affect the axe's actual proficiency. </li>
      </ul>
<p><strong>Version 7 - September 20, 2018</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Updated Chinese translation again; thanks angel_c4!</li>
        <li>Fixed bug where <strong>Unique Containers (Miloch)</strong> was not being applied to Potion Bags in IWD/IWDEE/IWD-in-BG2 games due to a typo </li>
        <li>Tried to make the text replacements for all of the <strong>Alter Weapon Proficiency System</strong> variants a little more robust when it comes to updating weapon proficiency text in item descriptions</li>
        <li>The components <strong>Move Boo out of quick access and into Minsc's pack</strong> and <strong>Move NPCs to Convenient Locations: Move Alora to Gullykin</strong>
were presenting the wrong component name in the installer</li>
        <li>The original Viconia dialogue file in BG had a syntax error, which would prompt the <strong>Move NPCs to Convenient Locations: Move Viconia to South Beregost Road</strong> component to display a harmless warning when installed; this component now fixes the error when installed</li>
        <li>The description for the <strong>Change Item Restrictions for Multi- and Dual-class Druids</strong> component has been clarified</li>
        <li><strong>Allow NPC pairs to separate</strong> now works for BG</li>
      </ul>
<p><strong>Version 6 - September 18, 2018</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Updated Chinese translation; thanks angel_c4!</li>
        <li>EET chapter numbers are now handled in a more uniform fashion</li>
        <li><strong>Give Every Class/Kit Four Weapon Slots</strong> wasn't working on IWDEE; thanks argent77 for the fix</li>
        <li>Potion bags were not getting unique icons; thanks agris for the fix</li>
        <li>The Anthology has now consolidated components from SCS and BG1NPC:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Send BioWare NPCs to an Inn</strong> is now expanded to cover all games with BG content (BGEE, BGT, Tutu, EET)</li>
            <li>Added <strong>Make Individual Strongholds Available</strong> components</li>
            <li><strong>Move NPCs from Baldur's Gate</strong> is now expanded to cover Viconia and Shar-Teel, and each NPC can be moved individually</li>
            <li><strong>Invisible Cloak of Mirroring</strong> is renamed and no longer nukes animations for the associated spells, to better facilitate combat feedback</li>
            <li>Assimilated <strong>Make party members less likely to die irreversibly</strong>; <strong>Allow BG NPC pairs to separate</strong>; <strong>BG NPCs go to inns</strong>; <strong>Allow Yeslick to use axes</strong>; <strong>Move Boo out of quick access and into Minsc's pack</strong>; <strong>Stackable ankheg shells, winterwolf pelts and wyvern heads</strong>; <strong>Ensure Shar-Teel doesn't die in the original challenge</strong></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version 5 - August 21, 2018</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Various components would fail to install on IWD2 since the underlying macros could fail for non-BG2 resources. </li>
        <li>Another run has been made to get all options of <strong>Adjust Cromwell's Forging Time</strong> to work for all platforms. </li>
        <li>The level 2/1 and 4/3 versions of Khalid in<strong> Make Khalid a Fighter-Mage (Domi)</strong> have been bumped slightly to bring his hit points in line with the other versions</li>
        <li><strong>Disable Non-Hostile Rest Spawns</strong> and <strong>Alter Hostile Rest Spawns</strong> will no longer fail on areas that lack rest spawn info. </li>
        <li>Updated the Simplified Chinese translation, thanks to c4_angel!</li>
        <li>Updated the French translation, courtesy of Isaya</li>
        <li><strong>Reputation Resets at Beginning of BG2</strong> is no longer an option for EET games, as this is already the default for EET</li>
        <li>Added new components: <strong>Death Cam</strong>, <strong>NPCs Cannot Pass Doors</strong>, <strong>Start New Games with Party AI Turned Off</strong>, <strong>No Depreciation in Stores</strong>, <strong>Disable Romances</strong>, and <strong>Accelerate/Decelerate Romances</strong></li>
        <li>Updated the fl#add_kit_ee.tpa library (for EE kits) to the latest version</li>
        <li>Fixed a bug where <strong>Loosen Item Restrictions for Multi- and Dual-class Clerics</strong> and <strong>Change Item Restrictions for Multi- and Dual-class Druids</strong> could fail with a malformed 2da file. </li>
        <li><strong>Allow Cromwell to Upgrade Watcher's Keep Items</strong> now accounts for the formula changes introduced by Item Revisions</li>
        <li>The greater werewolf form in <strong>Shapeshifter Rebalancing</strong> now receives the promised base THAC0 of 6</li>
        <li>Various components, especially in the rules section, were being made available for IWD2 games even though they did not apply</li>
      </ul>
<p><strong>Version 4 - November 22, 2017</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Added <strong>Personalize Automatic Save Names</strong> component; thanks argent77!</li>
        <li>Updated French translation, thanks Isaya!</li>
        <li>Fixed bug with the <strong>Romance Cheats</strong> component where Viconia's romance wouldn't start</li>
        <li>Fixed bug with the <strong>Romance Cheats</strong> component where it would fail if a non-number was entered when it prompted you for '1 or 2' input</li>
        <li>Fixed bug with <strong>Exotic Items</strong> where it would corrupt stores where it added scimitars, e.g. scrambling strings in the store's drink menu</li>
        <li>Fixed bug with <strong>Exotic Items</strong> where it could fail to install on some Tutu games</li>
        <li>Externalized strings for the <strong>Universal Clubs</strong> component to make it easier for translators </li>
        <li><strong>Increase Jewelry and Gem Stacks</strong> or <strong>Increase Scroll Stacking</strong> components would try to adjust dialogues and scripts to only take one item in vanilla BG/TotSC, but the functionality is not available in these games. </li>
        <li>Fixed bug with <strong>Commoners Use Drab Colors</strong> where it could sometimes fail to install on vanilla BG2</li>
        <li>The options in <strong>Adjust Cromwell's Forging Time</strong> have been re-ordered to work around a WeiDU quirk (this component could get skipped  when it should be available)</li>
        <li><strong>Description Updates for Make +x/+y Weapons Consistent Component</strong> was being skipped for Chinese players, even though it was available</li>
        <li><strong>Remove Racial Restrictions for Single Classes</strong> was not actually altering the dwarven charisma cap; now they really can be paladins</li>
        <li><strong>Remove Racial Restrictions for Kits</strong> had an error in its internal kit check, the upshot of which is that several kits were not actually being made available to all races</li>
        <li>The option to loosen item restrictions in <strong>Change Item Restrictions for Multi- and Dual-class Druids</strong> was not working</li>
        <li>Fixed bug with <strong>Lightning Bolts Don't Bounce</strong> where it could potentially fail when encountering items with non-standard structures</li>
        <li>Fixed bug with <strong>ToB-Style NPCs</strong> on  BGT, where BG Imoen  would be a thief/mage</li>
        <li>Tweaks now supports translated readmes, should anyone wish to try their hand</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version 3 - July 31, 2017</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Bottomless Bags of Holding</strong> now works for PsTEE</li>
        <li>The <strong>Exotic Item Pack</strong> could fail to install on EET, BGT, or BG due to typos and a missing library. Strings for the items could also potentially be incorrect.</li>
        <li><strong>Increase Ammo Stack Size</strong> had a typo in the library that would prevent installation</li>
        <li><strong>Disable Non-Hostile Rest Spawns</strong> and <strong>Alter Hostile Rest Spawns</strong> were also enabling <strong>Rest Anywhere</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Level-Locked Spell Scrolls</strong> now covers divine spell scrolls, and allows for casting of spells one level beyond spells available to the priest or mage</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Auto-Assign Advanced AI Scripting to Party</strong> will now assign the &quot;DEFAULT&quot; script, instead of none, to party members</li>
        <li>Updated Chinese translation thanks to c4_angel</li>
        <li>Updated variable names for the <strong>Romance Cheats</strong> component</li>
        <li> <strong>Level-Locked Spell Scrolls</strong> is no longer an option for IWD/BG games,   as these engines ignore minimum level requirements in item files</li>
        <li><strong>Lightning Bolts Don't Bounce</strong> will now protect the caster from being hit by his/her own lightning bolt for games which still use a multi-target projectile (everything but IWD/BG, which use a single-target projectile that can't hurt the caster)</li>
        <li><strong>Alter Druid Spell and Level Progression Tables</strong>, specifically the option to have druids use the cleric XP progression table, is now available for IWD/BG games</li>
        <li>The option to tighten restrictions via <strong>Change Item Restrictions for Multi- and Dual-class Druids</strong> is now more selective about tightening restrictions; among other things this fixes a bug where Jaheira got locked out of her Harper Pin</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version 2 - July 27, 2017</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Added several new components: <strong>Separate Resist Fire/Cold Portrait Icon into Separate Icons</strong>, <strong>Adjust Cromwell's Forging Time</strong>, <strong>Level-Locked Spell Scrolls</strong>, <strong>Allow Mages to Use Bucklers and Thieves to Use Small Shields</strong>, <strong>Lightning Bolts Don't Bounce</strong>, <strong>Give Every Class/Kit Four Weapon Slots</strong>, and <strong>Don't Auto-Assign Advanced AI Scripting to Party</strong></li>
        <li>Tweaks Anthology will no longer install on games that require Modmerge and instead point users to Modmerge and how to install it</li>
        <li>The mod will better detect PsTEE games and offer components appropriately. This better detection also addresses some other  bugs, such as the <strong>Rest Anywhere</strong> component not working on PsTEE. </li>
        <li>The <strong>Exotic Item Pack</strong> was rewritten to address some minor bugs and streamline the code; the Katana +2 had its effect percentages corrected</li>
        <li><strong>Wear Multiple Protection Items</strong> has a new option, <em>Allow Armor Plus One Protection Item</em></li>
        <li><strong>Loosen Item Restrictions for Multi- and Dual-class Druids</strong> is now <strong>Change Item Restrictions for Multi- and Dual-class Druids</strong>, as you now have options to loosen or tighten these restrictions. </li>
        <li><strong>Allow Cromwell to Upgrade Watcher's Keep Items</strong> was streamlined a bit, mainly to make the new Cromwell component easier to write</li>
        <li>All <strong>Alter Weapon Proficiency System</strong> options save <em>Rebalanced Profiencies</em> could potentially rob joinable NPCs of overall pips since various proficiencies could get combined. These &quot;duplicate proficiency&quot; points are now re-assigned so that joinable NPCs retain their correct total of weapon pips. </li>
        <li><strong>Maximum HP Creatures</strong> was not properly accounting for dual-class characters, potentially shorting their maximum HPs</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version 1 - June 11, 2017</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>A new configuration file, cdtweaks.txt, is now available in the mod's folder. Players can use this file to set inputs for the <strong>Romance Cheats</strong> and <strong>Minimum Stats Cheat</strong> components prior to installation. Doing so will allow the mod to be installed unattended, e.g. as part of a Big World Setup install. If the configuration file is not utilized, or indicates no changes, the player will be prompted during installation of these components, just like before. </li>
        <li>Added <strong>Remove Blur Effect from Equipped Items</strong> and <strong>Exceptional Strength Weight Limit Changes </strong> components</li>
        <li><strong>Reveal City Maps</strong> is not actually the default for BGT, so this component is now available</li>
        <li>Fixed a bug with <strong>Do Not Reveal City Maps</strong> where it could stuff other on-load actions in area scripts</li>
        <li><strong>Gems and Potions Require Identification</strong> now has the option to just affect gems, just affect potions, or both</li>
        <li>Fixed two bugs with the <strong>Change Experience Point Cap</strong> &gt; <em>Remove Completely</em> option. It was not extending the shaman spell tables, causing shamans to lose spellcasting ability after level 40. In addition, players on BGEE/SoD games would get trapped at the level-up screen on high levels, since the game had HLA tables defined but no HLAs to select. </li>
        <li>With the BG1 NPC Project installed, Shar-Teel could still leave due to high reputation with the <strong>Happy Patch </strong>installed. This is no longer the case. </li>
        <li><strong>No Traps or Locks</strong> had a small bug where it could overwrite flags in the area file. It also tries to be a bit more precise on which traps and locks to remove. </li>
        <li>Fixed a bug with the <em>Multiple Romances </em>option of <strong>Romance Cheats</strong> where the original BioWare romances could possibly stall after meeting the Gorion-wraith in Throne of Bhaal. </li>
        <li>Closed an exploit with <strong>Stores Purchase All Item Types</strong> where special stores--such as Officer Vai in Beregost--could be used for money generation due to their special buy/sell markups. </li>
        <li>Fixed bug with <strong>Taerom Makes Additional Ankheg Armors</strong> where he was not checking for the correct item in Tutu games to reset his armor timer</li>
        <li><strong>Improved Fate Spirit Summoning</strong> is no longer available for install on EET games, as EET includes similar functionality by default</li>
        <li>The armor lookup table used by <strong>Allow Stealth and Thieving Abilities in Heavy Armor per P&amp;P</strong>, <strong>Allow Arcane Spellcasting in Armor</strong>, and <strong>Icon Improvements</strong> has been expanded with new items, notably EET. </li>
        <li>The werewolf paws in <strong>Shapeshifter Rebalancing</strong> are now flagged as two-handed items to prevent their use in the offhand or with a shield. </li>
        <li><strong>Alter Weapon Proficiency System</strong> &gt; <em>Rebalanced Weapon Proficiencies</em> should now be more reliable updating weapon proficiency names in items, specifically ninja-t&#333;, in EE games. </li>
        <li>Fixed bug with <strong>Unique Containers</strong> trying to patch a mod item that was not a bag. </li>
        <li>If the <strong>Increase Jewelry and Gem Stacks</strong> or <strong>Increase Scroll Stacking</strong> components make an item stackable where it was not, actions in scripts and dialogues could potentially take an entire stack of these items where previously they only took one item. The component will now adjust these actions to only take one item. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version Beta 5 - July 27, 2016</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Wear Multiple Protection Items</strong> will no longer fail when patching items that have effects listed before abilities (thanks Nythrun, Ardanis, and Mike1072)</li>
        <li>Improved EET compatibility (thanks K4thos)</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version Beta 4 - May 1, 2016</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Make Magic Shields Glow</strong> had two bugs preventing its installation; it would halt on games without an extended color palette (e.g. non-EE games or without 1pp) and would halt on shields without any colors set, such as IWD's Lyre of Progression</li>
        <li><strong>Unique Containers</strong> was supposed to be available for BGEE, but  was omitted from the allowed platforms list for the component</li>
        <li>The werewolf paws in <strong>Shapeshifter Rebalancing</strong> now get named explicitly</li>
        <li><strong>Move NPCs from Baldur's Gate</strong> will now be skipped if the SCS version of same is installed. The component will also skip NPCs already moved by similar components in the BG1 NPC Project, or skip the component altogether if all three have been moved already. </li>
        <li><strong>Change Experience Point Cap</strong> should now work on Siege of Dragonspear</li>
        <li>Included workarounds for incomplete 25stweap.2da in Siege of Dragonspear and IWDEE for the various components that touch kits (<strong>Enforce PnP Proficiency Rules on Dual-Classed Characters</strong> and <strong>Expanded Dual-Class Options</strong>), though the next  patches should take care of this. In general, the component should be more forgiving for incomplete files. </li>
        <li> <strong>Remove Racial Restrictions for Single Classes</strong> and <strong>Remove Racial Restrictions for Kits</strong> will no longer allow non-human monks. Other races do not have monk animations so the engine tends to crash during character generation. Support for shamans has been added to both. </li>
        <li>If <strong>Druids Use 3e Alignment Restrictions</strong> was installed after <strong>Shapeshifter Rebalancing</strong>, which is the likely install order, non-true neutral shapeshifter druids would not be able to use their symbolic paws. </li>
        <li>On a suggestion from Sam., the component <strong>Stores Purchase All Item Types</strong> has been added. </li>
        <li><strong>Minimum Stats Cheat</strong> now lets you specify minimums for the six attributes individually.</li>
        <li><strong>Friendly Random Drops</strong> needed a few more fixes
          <ul>
            <li>The 'Token Genie' was  undead, meaning a cleric could turn or even chunk him. </li>
            <li>Items with charges should now be handled in a more robust fashion</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The library for fixing kit.ids as part of should now be up to date for <strong>Expanded Dual-Class Options</strong></li>
        <li>The BG and IWD variants of <strong>Alter Weapon Proficiency System</strong> should now account for racial bonuses in the EE games</li>
        <li><strong>Sensible Entrance Points</strong> only modifies the Beregost entrance point for BG content on BGT games, as BGT already defines good entrances for the other areas. </li>
        <li>Updated Italian translation, thanks          improb@bile!</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version Beta 3 - March 20, 2016</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Miloch's <strong>Unique Containers</strong> mod has been added to Tweaks as a cosmetic component, including all of its original options and translations. If <strong>Add Bags of Holding</strong> is installed after it, the new bags will use the unique icons. </li>
        <li>Added <strong>Use Character Colors Instead of Item Colors</strong> component</li>
        <li>Added components <strong>Everyone Gets Bonus APR from Specialization (subtledoctor)</strong> and <strong>Enforce PnP Proficiency Rules on Dual-Classed Characters (subtledoctor)</strong> courtesy of subtledoctor</li>
        <li><strong>Make Magic Shields Glow</strong> will now try to read in an appropriate glow color from the palette bitmap instead of a (limited) lookup table</li>
        <li>Fixed a bug with <strong>Higher HP on Level Up</strong> &gt; <em>NWN-Style</em>; withdrew the <em>Low Variance Rolls</em> option due to the same bug</li>
        <li>Fixed a math error in <strong>Change Experience Point Cap</strong> &gt; <em>Remove Completely</em> that caused bards and thieves to need an extra 100,000 XP to advance from level 39 to 40</li>
        <li>Fixed a bug with <strong>Send BioWare NPCs to an Inn</strong> where it wouldn't install on vanilla Baldur's Gate due to bad tra references (thanks Angel)</li>
        <li><strong>Friendly Random Drops</strong> was failing to account for two random drops in IWDEE that are different compared to IWD+UB; the fix in beta 2 caused it to not install on vanilla IWD, which is in turn fixed (thanks to Angel again)</li>
        <li>The <strong>Change Avatar When Wearing Robes or Armor (Galactygon)</strong> component is being withdrawn, as One Pixel Productions has a superior solution</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version Beta 2 - March 8, 2016</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed bug with <strong>Commoners Use Drab Colors</strong> where commoners ended up looking like they were made of chocolate instead</li>
        <li><strong>Unique Icons</strong> was expanded to BG2 games; also fixed a bug where it was not updating helmet animations</li>
        <li>After discussion, <strong>Rest Anywhere</strong> was expanded into multiple components. The main component continues to work as the original, and <strong>Disable Non-Hostile Rest Spawns</strong> and <strong>Alter Hostile Rest Spawns</strong> have been added to give players a finer grain of control. </li>
        <li><strong>Friendly Random Drops</strong> could pull from the wrong table in IWDEE.</li>
        <li>Fixed a bug with <strong>Friendly Random Drops</strong> &gt; <em>Choose Your Drop</em> where it was not accounting for Orrick's reward after you bring him the Mythal book. Also fixed the bug that would cause the Kuldahar merchant to leave after the orog attack, for real this time. </li>
        <li>All BAMs in the mod converted to uncompressed for better cross-platform goodness. </li>
        <li>Fixed a couple of bugs where <strong>Faster Chapter 1&amp;2 Cut-Scenes &amp; Dreams</strong> was not quite matching and replacing everything it should and Gaelan's dialogue lacked the shortcuts it was supposed to have</li>
        <li><strong>Faster Chapter 1&amp;2 Cut-Scenes &amp; Dreams</strong> will skip adjusting the Irenicus-Cowled Wizard cutscene in the Promenade if the player has installed <strong>Extended Waukeen's Promenade Cutscene</strong> from Almateria's Restoration Project. Other cutscenes and dreams are still affected in this case. </li>
        <li>Fixed bug with <strong>Increase Potion Stacking</strong> where it handled items with multiple charges incorrectly; thanks argent77!</li>
        <li>OS X version now up to date with WeiDU v239, as the Windows version; thanks argent77 again!</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version Beta 1 - March 2, 2016</strong> (changes from BG2 Tweaks v16, the most direct ancestor)</p>
      <ul>
        <li>New components:
          <ul>
            <li>New - <strong>Baldur's Gate  Casting Graphics, Max HP at Level One</strong>, <strong>Recoverable ammunition (argent77)</strong>, <strong>Recoverable throwing weapons (argent77)</strong></li>
            <li>From BG1 Tweaks - <strong>Make Magic Shields Glow (plainab/grogerson)</strong>, <strong>Send BioWare NPCs to an Inn (DavidW/Zed Nocear), Portable Containers (Zed Nocear)</strong>, <strong>Friendly Arm Inn Hidden Container Restoration (plainab)</strong>, <strong>Move NPCs from Baldur's Gate</strong>, <strong>Bardic Reputation Adjustment, Change Cloakwood Mine Chapter End Change Trigger to Non-TotSC Behavior, Paladins Use IWD-HoW Spell Progression Tables (grogerson), Rangers Use IWD-HoW Spell Progression Tables (grogerson), Druids Use 3e Alignment Restrictions, Loosen Item Restrictions for Multi- and Dual-class Clerics, Loosen Item Restrictions for Multi- and Dual-class Druids</strong>, <strong>Taerom Makes Additional Ankheg Armors (Icendoan/grogerson)</strong>, <strong>Give Coran A Legal Dexterity Score of 19</strong>, and <strong>Make Xan a Generalist Mage (Mike1072)</strong></li>
            <li>From IWD-in-BG2 Fixpack/Tweaks - <strong>Game ends when the main character dies</strong>; <strong>NPCs respond to the main character, not to whichever character talks to them; Make Heart of Winter accessible at any level</strong>; and <strong>Restore BG2 spells and make scrolls available</strong>, and <strong>Never lose access to Orrick the Grey's trade goods</strong></li>
            <li>From IWD Tweaks - <strong>Friendly Random Drops</strong>, <strong>Restore IWD Loading Screens (icelus)</strong>, and <strong>Unique Icons</strong></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed an original game bug with <strong>Alter HP Triggers for NPC Wounded
          Dialogues</strong> that would affect Edwin's wounded dialogue</li>
        <li>Fixed a bug with <strong>Gradual Drow Item Disintegration</strong>; items should have a chance to break upon use</li>
        <li>Improved <strong>Improved Multi-Player Kick-out Dialogues</strong> further with input from BG1 Tweaks; NPCs in BG now have more places to go when kicked out</li>
        <li><strong>Gems and Potions Require Identification</strong> now uses different scales for determining lore for gems vs. potions; also capped max lore to identify at 100</li>
        <li>Fixed multiple bugs with <strong>Multiple Strongholds</strong>. In the <em>No Restrictions</em> variant, it would fail to account for the shifted clerical stronghold alignments in BG2EE. Notably, this meant no one would spawn after Gaal's speech in the Temple district. Also fixed a bug where the druid restriction was still in place, preventing the messenger who would summon you back to the Grove. Also fixed a bug where both variants could bypass the bard stronghold XP reward from Raelis for rescuing the troupe from the Planar Prison. </li>
        <li><strong>Bonus Merchants (Baldurdash, Weimer)</strong> now places a little more nicely with other mods. </li>

        <li>The armor lookup table used by <strong>Allow Stealth and Thieving Abilities in Heavy Armor per P&amp;P</strong>, <strong>Allow Arcane Spellcasting in Armor</strong>, and <strong>Icon Improvements</strong> has been expanded with new items and now allows for individual armor values instead of trying to broadly categorize items. </li>
        <li>kit.ids is now properly patched as part of <strong>Expanded Dual-Class Options</strong></li>
        <li>Fixed a fairly large and glaring oversight with <strong>Wear Multiple Protection Items</strong> &gt; <em>P&amp;P Restrictions</em> where the items with AC bonuses could still be worn together</li>
        <li><strong>Alter Weapon Proficiency System</strong> underwent a significant revamp. Most notably, DavidW's IWD options from IWD-in-BG2 are now available, and the BG system was improved with some of the techniques from the IWD system. </li>
        <li><em>True Grandmastery</em> is now one option in <strong>Change Grandmastery Bonuses</strong> instead of a standalone component, as a BG2 option has been added. </li>
        <li>Added two new options to <strong>Higher HP on Level Up</strong>: <em>Average</em> and <em>Low Variance Rolls</em>. Also adjusted <em>NWN-style</em> to be a little more accurate. </li>
        <li>Expanded and renamed <strong>Increase Ammo Stack Size</strong>, <strong>Increase Jewelry and Gem Stacks</strong>, <strong>Increase Potion Stacking</strong>, and <strong>Increase Scroll Stacking</strong> to include four options: 40, 80, 120, and unlimited (999). <strong>Increase Jewelry and Gem Stacks</strong> also covers furs, pelts, and other miscellany like bandit scalps</li>

        <li>Added more NPCs to the <strong>Improved Fate Spirit Summoning</strong> component</li>
        <li><strong>ToB-Style NPCs</strong> should now have a more robust method of finding joinable NPCs and their creature files</li>
        <li><strong>Consistent Stats: Viconia</strong> should now better adjust her spellbook to account for the gain or loss of bonus spells due to the change in wisdom</li>
        <li>Fixed similar issues with <strong>Make Khalid a Fighter-Mage (Domi)</strong> and <strong>Make Montaron an Assassin (Andyr)</strong>; now it checks for walking speeds on non-Tutu games,  better adjusts proficiencies for the alternative schemes, and now  work if installed after <strong>ToB-Style NPCs</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Faster Chapter 1&amp;2 Cut-Scenes &amp; Dreams (Karzak, Blucher,
          aVENGER, Weimer) </strong> no longer overwrites scripts, which was causing a compatibility issue with BGT</li>
        <li>Added compatibility for EET</li>

      <p> The Tweaks Anthology is a <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr> compilation of nearly 400 components of cosmetic changes, house rules, and other tweaks. Some of these were fan requests, others are needed changes, and others simply make dealing with the more irritating aspects of the game engine easier. Each component can be installed separately so the player can pick and choose only which ones they wish to install. </p>

      <p> This mod includes and deprecates a slew of other mods: the <abbr title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</abbr> Tweak Pack, the <abbr title="The Gibberlings Three">G3</abbr> Tweak Pack, the Tutu Tweak Pack, Wes Weimer&#39;s Ease-of-Use, the Icewind Dale Tweak Pack, the Icewind Dale II Tweak Pack, the Baldur&#39;s Gate Tweak Pack, and the Planescape: Torment Tweak Pack. </p>
      <p> This mod works on all Infinity Engine games. This includes </p>
      <ul>
        <li> The series of Enhanced Editions (<abbr title="Enhanced Edition">EE</abbr>) published by Beamdog, which at present includes Baldur&#39;s Gate: Enhanced Edition (<abbr title="Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition">BGEE</abbr>), Baldur&#39;s Gate II: Enhanced Edition (<abbr title="Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition">BG2EE</abbr>), Icewind Dale: Enhanced Edition (<abbr title="Icewind Dale: Enhanced Edition">IWDEE</abbr>), and Planescape: Torment: Enhanced Edition (<abbr title="Planescape: Torment: Enhanced Edition">PsTEE</abbr>). The <abbr title="Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition">BGEE</abbr> Siege of Dragonspear expansion (<abbr title="Siege of Dragonspear">SoD</abbr>) is supported as well. All of the Enhanced Edition games include the original expansion packs, e.g. <abbr title="Icewind Dale: Enhanced Edition">IWDEE</abbr> includes Heart of Winter and Trials of the Luremaster. </li>
        <li> The original Baldur&#39;s Gate (<abbr title="Baldur's Gate">BG</abbr>), with or without the Tales of the Sword Coast (<abbr title="Tales of the Sword Coast">TotSC</abbr>) expansion </li>
        <li> The original Baldur&#39;s Gate II (<abbr title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</abbr> or just Shadows of Amn (<abbr title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</abbr>)), with or without the Throne of Bhaal (<abbr title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</abbr>) expansion </li>
        <li> The conversion projects Baldur&#39;s Gate Trilogy (<abbr title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</abbr>), Baldur&#39;s Gate Tutu (Tutu), Icewind Dale-in-Baldur&#39;s Gate II (<abbr title="Icewind Dale">IWD</abbr>-in-<abbr title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</abbr>), and Enhanced Edition Trilogy (<abbr title="Enhanced Edition Trilogy">EET</abbr>) </li>
        <li> The original Icewind Dale (<abbr title="Icewind Dale">IWD</abbr>) with or without either of its expansions, Heart of Winter (<abbr title="Heart of Winter">HoW</abbr>) and Trials of the Luremaster (<abbr title="Trials of the Luremaster">TotLM</abbr>) </li>
        <li> Icewind Dale II (<abbr title="Icewind Dale II">IWD2</abbr>), with or without the  Enhanced Edition (IWD2EE) mod</li>
        <li> Planescape: Torment (<abbr title="Planescape: Torment">PsT</abbr>)</li>
        <li>There also two mods that directly affect engine functionality, and may be required for various components and will be noted accordingly. For games based on the original <abbr title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</abbr> engine, <a href="https://www.spellholdstudios.net/ie/tobex/"><abbr title="ToB Extender">TobEx</abbr></a> and <a href="https://github.com/Spellhold-Studios/TobEx-AfterLife"><abbr title="ToB Extender">TobEx</abbr> AfterLife</a> are available; for the Enhanced Editions there's <a href="https://github.com/Bubb13/EEex">EEex</a>. </li>
      </ul>
      <p> While the mod works on all of these platforms, not every component is available for every game; check the individual components for details using the acronyms listed above. Every component in this mod makes interactive changes and should, in general, be compatible with other mods. Except where noted, the tweaks adjust items, dialogues, and other resources added by other mods. As such, it is highly recommended that you install this mod last if you wish to take full advantage of it. For example, installing a mod that adds weapons after you install Alter Weapon Proficiency System from Anthology will mean that the mod&#39;s weapons may not use the new system. </p>

      <p> If you should encounter any bugs, please report them to the authors at the <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forum/34-tweaks-anthology-forum/">Tweaks Anthology</a> forum. In addition, Tweaks Anthology is <a href="https://github.com/Gibberlings3/Tweaks-Anthology">available on GitHub</a>, so fixes and changes can be submitted by the community. </p>
      <p> Known issues are as follows: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> The <em>nothing kills romances</em> option of <strong>Romance Cheats [Sabre, Richardson, Weimer]</strong> should be used with caution with third-party <abbr title="Non-Player Character">NPC</abbr> romance mods. </li>
        <li> <strong>Multiple Strongholds [Sabre, Baldurdash, Weimer]</strong> (either variant) may not work correctly with <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/mods/quests/oversight/">Oversight</a>&#39;s Cleric Kits component </li>
        <li> The changes to Cromwell&#39;s dialogue in the <strong>Allow Cromwell to Upgrade Watcher&#39;s Keep Items</strong> component should play nicely with other mods, provided the other mods don&#39;t mangle his dialogue (ancient versions of <a href="https://forums.pocketplane.net/index.php?board=43.0">Item Upgrade</a>, for example) </li>
        <li> Certain mod armors  may not be affected by the armor tweaks&mdash;in some cases, the tweak can&#39;t be made on the fly, so items to be modified are kept on static lists rather than a list made at installation time. If you find items not being modified by a certain tweak please report it to the <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/forum/34-tweaks-anthology-forum/">Tweaks Anthology forum</a>. </li>
        <li> The <strong>Increase Jewelry, Gem, and Miscellaneous Item Stacks</strong> and <strong>Increase Scroll Stacking</strong> can sometimes &#39;install with warnings&#39;. This is because they must decompile-and-compile many dialogues in the game to adjust triggers and they&#39;ll spit out warnings for any existing syntax errors. </li>
        <li> The <em>remove spell trap and reflection effects</em> option from <strong>Remove Annoying Visual Effects from Equipped Items</strong> will block <em>all</em> sources of these animations when an adjusted item is equipped, e.g. the Shield of Balduran will block not only its own animation but also animations from the Physical Mirror or Spell Trap spells </li>
        <li> <strong>Loosen Equipment Restrictions for Cleric Multi- and Dual-Classes</strong> and the 'Loosen' option for <strong>Change Equipment Restrictions for Druid Multi- and Dual-Classes</strong> have the same bug: on the <abbr title="Enhanced Editions">EEs</abbr>, dual-classes (either to or from cleric or druid) cannot place proficiency pips in weapons that the base class can't use, e.g. fighter/cleric and fighter/druid dual-classes cannot place pips in bastard swords even though the component now makes them usable. More information (and a workaround) is available in the descriptions on the components.</li>
        <li><strong>Cantrips Class Feat for Spellcasters [Luke]</strong> currently does not work with Bubb's Spell Menu Extended. We hope to addres this in a future release. </li>

        Good Old Games (<abbr title="Good Old Games">GOG</abbr>) and Steam both package the additional content for Siege of Dragonspear in a method that <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr>, the tool used to install this mod, cannot access. You must run a program called <a href="https://github.com/Argent77/A7-DlcMerger/releases"><abbr title="Downloadable Content">DLC</abbr> Merger</a> on your <abbr title="Siege of Dragonspear">SoD</abbr> installation before you can install this or any other <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr>-based mod. </p>

        The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game&#39;s folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages. </p>

        The Tweaks Anthology for Windows is distributed as a self-extracting archive and includes a <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr> installer. To install, simply double-click the archive and follow the instructions on screen. </p>
      <p> Alternatively, the files can be extracted into your game directory using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a> or <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-cdtweaks.exe</strong> and the folder <strong>cdtweaks</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-cdtweaks.exe</strong> and follow the instructions on screen. </p>
      <p> You can run <strong>setup-cdtweaks.exe</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components. </p>

        The Tweaks Anthology for macOS is distributed as a compressed tarball and includes a <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr> installer. </p>
      <p> First, extract the files from the tarball into your game directory. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-cdtweaks</strong>, <strong>setup-cdtweaks.command</strong>, and the folder <strong>cdtweaks</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-cdtweaks.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen. </p>
      <p> You can run <strong>setup-cdtweaks.command</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components. </p>

        The Tweaks Anthology for Linux is distributed as a compressed tarball and does not include a <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr> installer. Linux users will need to do a one-time install of <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr> (and a few other adjustments) as described in <a href="https://moebiusproject.gitlab.io/mods_on_linux">this great writeup</a>. </p>

      <p> The Tweaks Anthology has many components, which can be installed completely independently of one another. For convenience, they are grouped into six broad categories: <a href="#contents_cosmetic">Cosmetic Changes</a>, <a href="#contents_content">Content Changes</a>, <a href="#contents_rules">Rule Changes</a>, <a href="#contents_convenience">Convenience Tweaks and/or Cheats</a>, <a href="#contents_npc">Joinable <abbr title="Non-Player Character">NPC</abbr> Tweaks</a>, and <a href="#contents_feats"><abbr title="Neverwinter Nights">NWN</abbr>-Style Feats</a>. At installation time, players can select or ignore entire categories to streamline the installation process. </p>
      <p> Italics running underneath each component indicate availability for various games. Unless specified, a component will work on a game with or without its expansions unless noted, e.g. a component labeled <em><abbr title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</abbr></em> would work on Baldur&#39;s Gate II with or without the Throne of Bhaal expansion. If the expansion is required or forbidden, the note will either be <em><abbr title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</abbr> (requires <abbr title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</abbr>)</em> or <em><abbr title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</abbr> (without <abbr title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</abbr>)</em> respectively. Components that are not available for your game will be skipped automatically by the installer. </p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>As of Version 17, Tweaks Anthology has added a batch installer. Normally, when you choose to install a component <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr> will execute the installation immediately, meaning you have to wait for the installation to finish before the next component prompts to be installed. If you use the batch installation option, you simply go through all of the prompts first, selecting what you want to install, and then at the very end <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr> will install all of the selected components. </p>
      <p>For a big mod with a lot of options, this can be a big time-saver. The trade-off is that, if one of the components has an error during installation, it means you won't be able to able to view or check the issues until after it's processed all of the other components selected. </p>
      <p>If you use the batch installer, a file will be generated with your selected options that you can use to reinstall or even use on other games. The file can be found in weidu_external/batch/cdtweaks and will be named batch_run.bat (on macOS or Linux, the file extension is .sh instead of .bat). </p>
      <p>The option to use batch installation is presented as the first component and will affect the rest of the installation process. </p>

      <p> By default, spears in <abbr title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</abbr> use 33% overhead swings, 33% backhand swings and only 34% thrusting attacks. Wouldn&#39;t it make more sense to use the pointy end? </p>
      <p> This component adjusts the attack animation balances of various weapons classes: spears, staves, short swords, and one-handed blunt instruments such as clubs and maces. Spears and short swords now primarily use thrusting attacks and staves are more consistent as a class and use more swinging attacks. A handful of clubs and maces were using thrust attacks; they now only use swinging attacks like all other one-handed blunt weapons. This component will affect <em>all</em> items in the game, including items introduced by mods. </p>

      <p> When your character casts a spell, you get a pretty sequence of colors swirling around their hand depending on the school the spell cast came from. A necromantic spell, for example, looks quite different from creating an illusion. The Baldur&#39;s Gate and Icewind Dale games use different sets of visual animations and sound effects for the schools. This component allows you to use the Icewind Dale graphics and audio on the Baldur&#39;s Gate series of games.

      <p> Icewind Dale, and to a lesser extent Baldur&#39;s Gate and Baldur&#39;s Gate II, has a frustrating habit of using the same icon for multiple items, making them difficult to tell apart from one another. Lava has created unique icons for about 200 items in Icewind Dale and about 140 in the Baldur&#39;s Gate series. For example, the dozen or so items that all used the icon for the Ring of Protection +1 in <abbr title="Icewind Dale">IWD</abbr> now use unique icons. A full display of the icons changed is available in <a href="https://gibberlings3.github.io/Documentation/readmes/readme-cdtweaks_unique_icons.html">separate documentation</a>. </p>
      <p>There are two options, based on whether you want to replace icons for items which may have been given a unique icon from another mod. For example, if another mod has already given the Robe of Vecna a unique icon, you can choose to override it with the one from this component, or leave it as-is, depending on which option you select.</p>

      <p> Originally a standalone mini-mod from Miloch, this mod has been incorporated into Anthology. There are three options; all three incorporate minor fixes (some for default stores in Tutu, some for other store mods). You can choose to install just the fixes, fixes plus unique containers, or fixes plus unique containers and names. You can see <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/gallery/image/504-unique-containers-miloch/">example icons</a> in the Anthology gallery. From the original readme: </p>
      <div class="quote">
        <p> &quot;This mini-mod assigns unique icons to all containers in the game. Containers include standard and mod-added bags of holding, gem bags, scroll cases, potion cases and ammo belts. The tweak allows you to identify containers at a glance by color and use them for a particular type of storage. Or it just makes your character&#39;s accessories color-coordinated. Optionally, you can assign unique names (based on the color) to the containers to differentiate them further. </p>
        <p> &quot;The mod will also fix various issues with stores and containers in both the unmodded (and Fixpacked) games, as well as with mods. Some of those mods include <abbr title="Big Picture">BP</abbr>, <abbr title="Check the Bodies">CtB</abbr>, <abbr title="Neverending Journey 2">NEJ2</abbr>, <abbr title="Reign of Terror">RoT</abbr> and <abbr title="Shadows Over Soubar">SOS</abbr>. Most significantly, it fixes some issues with Lost Items v2, including containers with duplicate stores attached and other mod usability issues pointed out by Bursk and SixOfSpades. You don&#39;t need to have any of these mods installed to use the main feature though.&quot; </p>
      </div>
      <p> <em>Note:</em> While the mod has been expanded to cover <abbr title="Icewind Dale">IWD</abbr>/<abbr title="Icewind Dale: Enhanced Edition">IWDEE</abbr>/<abbr title="Icewind Dale">IWD</abbr>-in-<abbr title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</abbr>, it will use <abbr title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</abbr>-style container icons instead of <abbr title="Icewind Dale">IWD</abbr>-style ones. </p>

      <p> In the original Baldur&#39;s Gate, shields and helmets generally took on the major/minor colors of the character wearing them. In Baldur&#39;s Gate II, most shields and helmets instead set fixed colors so that the paperdoll and game screen would always match the item icons. You can <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/gallery/image/503-use-character-colors-instead-of-item-colors/">see a comparison</a> in the Anthology gallery. This component allows you to use the <abbr title="Baldur's Gate">BG</abbr> behavior to allow helmets and shields to use character colors. The component allows you to select changing shield, helmets or both; and for choosing to alter all or just non-magical ones. </p>

        <li> <em>Remove all of the above</em> will cover both of the above options, disabling blur, spell trap, and reflection animations from equipped items. </li>
      </ul>

      <p> This component alters the color overlays for items to allow colorblind players to better distinguish the icons. The red overlay, now supplemented with an X, denotes unusable items for the character. A blue overlay, supplemented with ?, denotes an item that needs identification. A green overlay, exclusive to scrolls and supplemented with an O, denotes that the character can learn the spell on the scroll.

This component will interactively replace these faulty triggers with a simple in-party check, similar to the Valen or Solaufein mods. The net result is that some characters may be chiming in on conversations from half-a-map away, but it also means no more silliness such as Irenicus missing Yoshimo when he&#39;s standing four feet away. If party members are in another area, this component could cause some dialogues to exit early. This component will affect <em>all</em> dialogues and scripts in the game, including ones introduced by mods that use the IsValidForPartyDialogue trigger, provided this component is installed after them. </p>

      <p> Rather than your drow items turning to dust immediately upon exiting the Underdark, they will gradually degrade over time. They also have a chance to break every time they are used in combat. Please note that this component adds a number of item checks to the main game script; as such it can cause slowdowns when you have a very large number of items in your inventory and bags of holding. </p>

      <p> The iron crisis in the Sword Coast means that non-magical iron weapons can break when used in combat. This component will extend the same vulnerability to non-magical iron armor, helmets, and shields to close an oversight by the game. Every time the character is successfully hit, there's a 1% chance for the armor, helm, or shield to break. There are three variants, all of which change how armor behaves when hit (shields and helmets will become completely unusable on a single break in all three variants): </p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Everything just breaks</em> - Like weapons breaking, armor becomes unusable on the first break. </li>
        <li><em>Shields and helms break, armor degrades once</em> - On the first break, armor will degrade to about 40% effectiveness. A second break on the damaged armor will completely make the armor unusable. E.g. chain mail (<abbr title="Armor Class">AC</abbr> 5) will degrade to <abbr title="Armor Class">AC</abbr> 8 on the first break, and become worthless on the second break. </li>
        <li><em>Shields and helms break, armor progressively degrades and breaks</em> - On the first break, the armor will lose 2 <abbr title="Armor Class">AC</abbr> of effectiveness. Each consecutive break will remove another 1 <abbr title="Armor Class">AC</abbr> from its effectiveness, becoming completely unusable when it reaches the same <abbr title="Armor Class">AC</abbr> (10) as no armor. E.g. splint mail (<abbr title="Armor Class">AC</abbr> 4) will degrade to <abbr title="Armor Class">AC</abbr> 6 on the first break, then take three more breaks (degrading to <abbr title="Armor Class">AC</abbr> 7 then 8 then 9) and then becoming completely unusable on the fifth break. </li>
      </ul>

      <p> Please note that this is a legacy component from Wes Weimer&#39;s Ease-of-Use mod. Wes typically designed for balance under the assumption that people would have the Tactics mod installed, so this is probably overpowered for most normal games. The rest of the description is from the original Ease-of-Use readme: </p>
      <div class="quote">
        <p> Shapeshifter abilities now create &quot;symbolic paws&quot;. When you wield one you turn into a Werewolf, when you remove it you&#39;re human again. There are no possible exploits and you may choose whether to put the paw in your on-hand or off-hand. Since your off-hand <abbr title="To-Hit Armor Class 0">THAC0</abbr> as a pure druid is, shall we say, sub-optimal, I recommend the on-hand. This fixes the bug where the Shapeshifter&#39;s paws could be dispelled and then any weapon could be put in their place. That exploit essentially gave you two extra attacks with whatever you wanted, plus all the werewolf powers. </p>
        <p> This also fixes a &quot;bug&quot; where attributes of the creature file for &quot;<abbr title="Player Character">PC</abbr> polymorphed into a Werewolf&quot; were not actually given to the <abbr title="Player Character">PC</abbr> by the Polymorph opcode. For a normal werewolf: </p>

        <p> The &quot;Rebalancing&quot; gives a greater werewolf shapeshifter the +7 <abbr title="Hit Points">HP</abbr> per Level due to a fighter with 25 Constitution (before you just got +2). Most importantly, shapeshifters may now cast spells while shapechanged. Yuan-Ti, Githyanki, Sahuagin, &amp;c. can all cast spells&mdash;why not wolfmen? </p>
        <p> In addition, the druid spell choices were a bit weak in some areas, so some priest-only spells were made priest-druid: Sanctuary (sylvan sanctuaries abound), Chant (they got Bless, why not Chant?), Zone of Sweet Air (sounds nature-y to me!), Glyph of Warding (no excuse, but they need a damaging spell here that isn&#39;t Call Lightning), Righteous Magic (listen to Jaheira for a while and tell me she&#39;s not Righteous... more importantly, if they&#39;re going to tank around they need some extra help). </p>
        <p> Finally, 99% of all sixth-level druid spell slots go to &quot;Summon Fire Elemental&quot;. You can get a 24 hit dice monster with +4 claws that lasts for hours with that spell. It&#39;s so much better than the 7th level &quot;Summon Earth Elemental&quot; that it isn&#39;t funny. The other 6th-level summons just don&#39;t come close. To give you some actual choices, &quot;Conjure Animals&quot; has been changed to summon two 20 <abbr title="Hit Dice">HD</abbr> Greater Bearweres (they&#39;re like Greater Wolfweres). However, the duration remains 4 turns. Do you want Fire Elementals forever or Mighty Big Tanks for a short time? You decide. </p>

      <p> This component comes in two variants to open up acquisition of the <abbr title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</abbr> strongholds. The first is the original from Ease-of-Use, which allows any character, regardless of class, to acquire as many strongholds as wanted. The second variant is similar, but retains the class restrictions&mdash;so a fighter-mage can acquire the Planar Sphere and de&#39;Arnise Keep, but would not be offered the Thieves&#39; Guild or membership in the Noble Order of the Radiant Heart. In the original game, you were also not able to decline the Five Flagons Playhouse, the cabin in the Umar Hills, or the Druid Grove. In either variant of this component, the player can now decline these strongholds when offered. </p>

      <p> It&#39;s never made sense to me that Cromwell can forge armor out of red dragon scales, ankheg shells, and shadow dragon armor&mdash;but doesn&#39;t even acknowledge the white dragon scales you can acquire in Watcher&#39;s Keep. This component will allow Cromwell to forge items found in Watcher&#39;s Keep using the same formulae as Cespenar. (Note that only the formulae using items you can <em>legally</em> obtain in <abbr title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</abbr> are implemented; if you cheat in a component from Sendai&#39;s Enclave you&#39;ll still be out of luck.)

      <p> When you commission Cromwell for a special item, he says the forging will take a day to complete.

        <li><em>Don't change the main game:</em> This option doesn't make any changes to the main game. You can still start and even complete the <abbr title="Heart of Winter">HoW</abbr> expansion before beating the end boss of the main campaign.</li>
        <li><em>Remove Hjollder from Kuldahar:</em> This option removes Hjollder from Kuldahar which prevents you from starting the <abbr title="Heart of Winter">HoW</abbr> expansion before beating the end boss of the main campaign.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>By default the unarmed attacks of monks do crushing damage. This component allows monks to change between piercing/crushing/slashing/fist (non-lethal) damage through innate abilities that simulate  different hand weapons. Their normal crushing damage is now 'bare fists', piercing is done via 'punch daggers', slashing via 'claws' and  non-lethal via 'padded gloves'. </p>

      <p> It always seemed odd that the general description of bastard swords implied they could be wielded with two hands. This tweak adds an ability to all bastard swords that will create a two-handed version of the sword in your inventory. The one-handed version will be removed. The new sword will have the animation of a two-handed sword but, in all other respects, will be the same as the one-handed version. You can switch back to the one-handed version at any time. The ability is found behind the backpack icon, once the sword is equipped. This component will affect items introduced by mods. </p>
      <p> <em>Note:</em> Instances may occur when a bastard sword appears to have a selling price of 1 <abbr title="Gold Piece">gp</abbr>. Resting will fix this. </p>

      <p> A nod to Icewind Dale, this tweak adds an ability to all melee-only axes that will create a two-handed version of the axe in your inventory. The one-handed version will be removed.

The ability is found behind the backpack icon, once the axe is equipped. This component will affect items introduced by mods. Axes that are two-handed by default will remain two-handed.

        <em>All games except <abbr title="Icewind Dale II">IWD2</abbr></em> </p>
      <p> All games impose an experience cap. For example, in Baldur&#39;s Gate II, characters have a maximum experience point cap of 2,950,000 with Shadows of Amn or 8,000,000 with Throne of Bhaal. In Tutu and Baldur&#39;s Gate, these caps are 89,000 in the standard game and 161,000 with the Tales of the Sword Coast expansion. <abbr title="Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition">BGEE</abbr> uses the same 161,000 cap, but raises it to 500,000 if <abbr title="Siege of Dragonspear">SoD</abbr> is installed. This component will allow you to alter the experience point cap in one of three ways: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> <em>Remove completely</em> - characters can advance without restriction up to the hardcoded level maximum (usually level 50) </li>
        <li> <em>Level 20 experience point cap</em> - not available on all platforms </li>
        <li> <em>Level 30 experience point cap</em> - not available on all platforms </li>
      </ul>
      <p> For a challenge, combine the level 20 cap with Delay High Level Abilities in <abbr title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</abbr> to never get access to <abbr title="Use Any Item">UAI</abbr> and Improved Alacrity. </p>

        <em>All games except <abbr title="Icewind Dale II">IWD2</abbr></em> </p>
      <p> Thieves and rangers are prevented from using stealth and thieving skills while in heavy armor. This component implements the <abbr title="Pen and Paper">PnP</abbr> method of allowing these abilities in heavier armor, but at a penalty to the character. There is always a small chance of success or failure regardless of the adjustments below. Any armor above leather will impose penalties on these skills. This component will affect some mod items; if you find armor not affected by these tweaks, please report it at the <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forum/34-tweaks-anthology-forum/">Tweaks Anthology forum</a>. The adjustment of the item descriptions to reflect these changes has now been incorporated directly into this component and is done on-the-fly, so it should also catch mod-added items and reduce conflicts.

      <p> In older versions of the engine (original <abbr title="Baldur's Gate">BG</abbr> and <abbr title="Icewind Dale">IWD</abbr>), Move Silently and Hide in Shadows were a single stat called Stealth, and the armor changes in those games will just adjust Stealth.

      <p> This component allows players to wear more than one &quot;X of Protection&quot; item at a time. Players have their choice of three different implementations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> <em>No restrictions [from Ease-of-Use]:</em> Players can wear as many items together as they wish. </li>
        <li> <em><abbr title="Pen and Paper">PnP</abbr> restrictions [from <abbr title="The Gibberlings Three">G3</abbr>/Tutu Tweaks]:</em> In Pen and Paper <abbr title="Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons">AD&amp;D</abbr>, characters are allowed to wear magical armor with Rings/Cloaks/Amulets of Protection, but only the armor class bonus from one item would apply. This component gives every ring/cloak/amulet of protection the ability to be worn with or without its Armor Class bonus. With the <abbr title="Armor Class">AC</abbr> bonus, the items retain their usual restrictions from being worn with other protection items or magic armor. Without their <abbr title="Armor Class">AC</abbr> bonus, they can be worn together. This allows players to gain the benefits of the saving throw bonuses from the items of protection. To toggle between the versions that offer armor class bonuses and those without, use the item&#39;s special ability&mdash;the new item will be created in your inventory. </li>
        <li> <em>Allow armor plus one protection item [Angel]:</em> The player can wear magical armor plus one more protection item. </li>
      </ul>

      <p> This component provides five different options to allow you to change how the weapon proficiency system works. </p>
      <p> The first option, <em>rebalanced weapon proficiencies</em>, attempts to rebalance the groupings of weapons proficiencies. There are three main changes: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Wakizashis move from Wakizashi/Scimitar/Ninja-to to Katana proficiency </li>
        <li> Ninja-tos move from Wakizashi/Scimitar/Ninja-to to Short Sword proficiency </li>
        <li> Morningstars move from Flail/Morningstar to Mace proficiency </li>
      </ul>
      <p> Wakizashis are very similar to katanas in usage, and ninja-tos are straight, short blades. Morningstars, while there are several variations in definition, are essentially spiked maces in the game, and have been moved out of the flail category and grouped with maces. The proficiencies themselves get renamed to reflect these changes. Weapon descriptions also get updated if the translations are available. </p>
      <p> The second and third options, <em><abbr title="Baldur's Gate">BG</abbr>-style weapon proficiencies</em>, are variants of using the old <abbr title="Baldur's Gate">BG</abbr>-style system of proficiencies. In <abbr title="Baldur's Gate">BG</abbr>, the weapons proficiencies were not as specialized and there were only eight categories: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Bastard swords, long swords, two-handed swords, katanas, scimitars, wakizashis, and ninja-tos are combined into the Large Sword proficiency. </li>
        <li> Short swords and daggers are combined into the Small Sword proficiency. </li>
        <li> Hammers, maces, staves, and clubs are combined into the Blunt proficiency. </li>
        <li> Flails and morningstars are now the Spiked proficiency. </li>
        <li> Halberds and spears are combined in the Spear proficiency </li>
        <li> Crossbows, darts, and slings are combined in the Missile Weapon proficiency. </li>
        <li> Long and short bows are combined in the Bow proficiency. </li>
      </ul>
      <p> While mainly aimed at Tutu and <abbr title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</abbr> players to allow them to have a game experience closer to <abbr title="Baldur's Gate">BG</abbr>, these two options will work on any of the games listed in availability. The two options only vary in allowing the weapon style proficiencies (i.e. Two-Handed Weapon Style, Single Weapon Style, &amp;c.) to be included or not at the player&#39;s discretion. If you import your characters to another game without this component you will need to use an editor like Shadowkeeper or EEKeeper to change their proficiencies to the standard <abbr title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</abbr> set. </p>
      <p> The fourth and fifth options, <em><abbr title="Icewind Dale">IWD</abbr>-style proficiencies</em>, implement the Icewind Dale style proficiency system. Like the <abbr title="Baldur's Gate">BG</abbr>-style option, there are fewer proficiencies, but it&#39;s not as concentrated as the <abbr title="Baldur's Gate">BG</abbr>-style system. </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Bastard swords and two-handed swords are combined into the Great Sword proficiency. </li>
        <li> Long swords, katanas, scimitars, wakizashis, and ninja-tos are combined into the Large Sword proficiency. </li>
        <li> The Flail/Morningstar proficiency is renamed Flail proficiency and morningstars are moved into the Mace proficiency. </li>
        <li> Darts, and slings are combined in the Missile Weapon proficiency. </li>
        <li> Long and short bows are combined in the Bow proficiency. </li>
      </ul>
      <p> <abbr title="Icewind Dale">IWD</abbr>-style proficiencies also come with the option to keep or remove the weapon style proficiencies. </p>

        <em>All games</em> </p>
      <p> Scrolls and a few other items allow your party to cast spells from the item. When cast in this fashion, the spell is cast as if the character using the item is at a fixed level (for example, 10 in <abbr title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</abbr> or 6 in <abbr title="Baldur's Gate">BG</abbr>) in terms of determining damages, durations, &amp;c. This tweak will allow you to cast spells from items at your character&#39;s level, instead of the fixed value. One item to note here&mdash;the game will use your character&#39;s mage level; if you&#39;re in the habit of casting scrolls with your thief via Use Any Item, the spell will likely be cast at a minimum level. </p>

        <em>All games except <abbr title="Icewind Dale II">IWD2</abbr></em> </p>
      <p> This component makes the identification abilities of stores more in line with the shopkeepers&#39; abilities. There are three ways to implement this, and players are given a choice: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> <em>Only mage and bard storekeepers can identify items</em>. Any mage or bard storekeeper can identify any item; other storekeepers cannot identify items at all. </li>
        <li> <em>Identification ability is based on storekeeper&#39;s lore</em>. Any storekeeper can identify items up to their personal lore value, regardless of class. The shopkeepers are given a slight lore boost over normal characters to reflect their occupational experience with magical items. Items with exceptionally high lore may not be able to be identified at all by storekeepers. </li>
        <li> <em>Hybrid of both methods</em>. Mage and bard storekeepers can identify anything, and other storekeepers use lore scores based on their character. </li>
      </ul>

      <p> This is for players who believe that <abbr title="Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons">AD&amp;D</abbr>&#39;s dual-class and multi-class system is inherently broken and that there is no conceptual reason for multi-class characters to be denied grandmastery. Multi-class characters can now put more than two pips in things. In effect, any multi-class character that could put two stars in anything can now put five stars in that thing. </p>

        <em>All games except <abbr title="Icewind Dale II">IWD2</abbr></em> </p>
      <p> The first option, <em>true grandmastery [Baldurdash]</em>, is the standard Baldurdash/TeamBG &quot;un-nerfed&quot; grandmastery patch. In <abbr title="Icewind Dale">IWD</abbr>, <abbr title="Baldur's Gate">BG</abbr>, and <abbr title="Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons">AD&amp;D</abbr> guidelines, going from four to five proficiency points in a weapon reduces <abbr title="To-Hit Armor Class 0">THAC0</abbr> by one, adds one to damage rolls, and gives an extra attack per round to 5/2. In <abbr title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</abbr>, it only adds one to damage, taking the &quot;grand&quot; out of &quot;grandmastery&quot;. Install this patch to restore grandmastery to what it was. </p>
      <p> The second option, <em><abbr title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</abbr> grandmastery rules</em>, allows you to use <abbr title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</abbr> grandmastery in other games. </p>

      <p> Nearly all magically created items in <abbr title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</abbr> have zero weight, though there are a few exceptions. The reasoning is that if you had a low-strength mage, he or she could become encumbered by a weapon they can&#39;t drop. This component will change items such as Melf&#39;s Minute Meteors, Jan&#39;s Flasher Master Bruiser Mates, weapons created by Enchanted Weapon, Decastave, Shillelagh, and a few others to have zero weight.

      <p> The original <abbr title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</abbr> engine does not handle weapons such as the Bastard Sword +1/+3 vs. Shapeshifters, Hammer +1/+4 vs. Giantkin, and Daystar +2/+4 vs. Evil Creatures consistently. In all but a few cases, the weapon uses the higher of the two bonuses as its enchantment level, which determines what the weapon can hit&mdash;for example, spell protections such as Mantle or creatures such as Kangaxx. This component will make all weapons of this nature use the higher of the two bonuses as their enchantment; i.e. Daystar will be treated as a +4 weapon.

These are now combined and made more granular so that the player can select exactly which level and spell progression tables they wish to use. </p>
      <p>There are essentially two choices being offered. One is to change the druid's level progression, which notoriously has a huge jump at level 14/15 in the <abbr title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</abbr> games:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>No change</li>
        <li>Use cleric progression: use the existing <abbr title="Experience Points">XP</abbr> progression for clerics as the druid's <abbr title="Experience Points">XP</abbr> progression. </li>
        <li>Use the <a href="https://gibberlings3.github.io/iesdp/files/2da/2da_totl/xplevel.htm"><abbr title="Icewind Dale">IWD</abbr> druid progression</a> (only available for non-<abbr title="Icewind Dale">IWD</abbr> games): more or less the <abbr title="Baldur's Gate">BG</abbr>/<abbr title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</abbr> table, except the level 15 jump is only 300k and it's 225k for levels after. </li>
        <li>Use the <a href="https://gibberlings3.github.io/iesdp/files/2da/2da_bgee/xplevel.htm"><abbr title="Baldur's Gate">BG</abbr>/<abbr title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</abbr> druid progression</a> (only available for non-<abbr title="Baldur's Gate">BG</abbr>/<abbr title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</abbr> games): more or less the <abbr title="Icewind Dale">IWD</abbr> table, except the level 15 jump is 1.5M and further levels range from 150k to 500k. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>In addition to the <abbr title="Experience Points">XP</abbr> progression, the player can select a number of spell tables for the druid.

      <p> This component will max out the <abbr title="High-Level Ability">HLA</abbr> tables for fighter-mage-thieves and fighter-mage-clerics. Throne of Bhaal originally used the fighter-thief table for fighter-mage-thieves and the fighter-cleric table for fighter-mage-clerics. Both <abbr title="Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition">BG2EE</abbr> and <abbr title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</abbr> (with the <abbr title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</abbr> Fixpack installed) alter this so that the triple-classes have unique tables and add the three Extra 6/7/8 Level Spell <abbr title="High-Level Abilities">HLAs</abbr> from the mage tables. This component adds even more mage <abbr title="High-Level Abilities">HLAs</abbr> to the tables, at the expense of other <abbr title="High-Level Abilities">HLAs</abbr> from the other two classes. Fighter-mage-clerics lose access to Deathblow, Greater Deathblow, and War Cry and gain access to Improved Alacrity, Dragon&#39;s Breath, Summon (Dark) Planetar, and Comet. Fighter-mage-thieves lose access to Deathblow, Greater Deathblow, War Cry, Alchemy, and Scribe Scrolls and gain access to Energy Blades, Improved Alacrity, Dragon&#39;s Breath, Summon (Dark) Planetar, and Comet. Since triple-classes require 9 million <abbr title="Experience Points">XP</abbr> to reach a level where they can use 9th level mage spells, this component requires removal of the experience point cap. </p>

      <p> By request, this component will adjust spells to have save penalties when cast by high-level casters. For every five levels over the minimum level required to learn a spell, a -1 to saves will be imposed. </p>
      <p> For example, Hold Person is a second level cleric spell, and can be learned when a character hits level three. When the character hits level eight, the spell now has a -1 penalty to the victim&#39;s saving throw. At level 13 it&#39;s -2; at 18 it&#39;s -3, &amp;c. all the way out to -9 at level 48. The penalties are extended out to level 50 in case players are playing an <abbr title="Experience Points">XP</abbr> cap-free game or with one of the various level-50 rule sets. </p>
      <p> The penalties will work against you for spells from enemies, but I expect this component will, in general, probably make the game a lot easier. You&#39;ll have the choice to add these penalties to divine spells, arcane spells, or both. </p>

      <p> This component will restrict casting spells from scrolls to the level that the spell can normally be cast by a mage, plus one level beyond. For example, a fifth-level mage can memorize and cast spells of level three or below. With this tweak installed the mage would be able to use spell scrolls of level four or below, e.g. they could use a Stoneskin scroll (level four) but not a Cloudkill scroll (level five). These level requirements do not affect the ability of a mage to scribe a spell into their spellbook, just to cast spells from them. </p>

      <p>This component allows monks to use helmets, staves, or both. Any helmet and/or staff that is usable by single-class clerics and fighters will be made available to monks. </p>
      <ul>
        <li> <em>Helmets:</em> One of the issues with monks, especially for players on the harder difficulties, is that they have no way to receive critical hit protection. Only on <abbr title="Original Baldur's Gate II">oBG2</abbr>, since monks have <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/gallery/image/509-mask-of-king-strohm-vs-monks/">a serious animation glitch</a> when wearing helmets, it will also change their base animation to be a cleric unless the <strong>Remove Helmet Animations</strong> component is also installed. </li>
        <li><em>Staves: </em>This allows monks to use staves. If staves are enabled the monk animation has to be switched to a cleric animation since the normal monk animation doesn't support staff animations. Monks will be able to place the same number of weapon pips into staves that they can do in clubs and will get access to the Two-Handed weapon style. </li>
        <li><em>Both: </em>Enables both of the above options. </li>

      <p>A thief's ability  to use a weapon for backstabbing is tied to whether or not a  single-class thief can use an item. This means that even after a  thief gains access to the High Level Ability <em>Use Any Item</em> (<abbr title="Use Any Item">UAI</abbr>), they  are still unable to use some weapons for backstabbing even though  they should otherwise be allowed. This also applies to dual- or multi-classed thieves which gain access to a weapon through their other class. For example thieves can use  ninja-t&#333;s to backstab, but can't backstab with the Ninjat&#333; of the  Scarlet Brotherhood even though they can use it with <abbr title="Use Any Item">UAI</abbr>. Using new  functionality in the <abbr title="Enhanced Editions">EEs</abbr>, this component keeps the current  restrictions (a thief can't use the Ninjat&#333; of the Scarlet  Brotherhood until they get <abbr title="Use Any Item">UAI</abbr>), but once they can use it, it can be  used for backstabbing. </p>
      <p>Note that this makes  the Staff of the Magi (SotM) available for backstabbing. To prevent  abusing the SotM's invisibility-on-equip for multiple backstabs, one  additional change is made to the item: a successful melee attack  (including backstabbing) will prevent the wielder from re-entering  invisibility until a round has passed. The Staff of the Gorgon from the SP Collection has similar functionality and is also adjusted in the same way. </p>

      <p> Technically speaking, a rogue can backstab/sneak attack only <em>living creatures with discernible anatomies</em>.
        As a result, this component makes sure all those creatures that lack vital areas to attack are immune to backstabs/sneak attacks. This includes the following creatures: </p>

        <li>Undead</li>
        <li>Plants</li>
        <li>Oozes</li>

      </ul>
      <p>On top of that: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> The amount of damage/healing is randomized. In particular:
          <ul>
            <li>Cure/Cause Light Wounds: 1d8 (+1 per caster level, up to +5); Save vs. Spell for half damage</li>
            <li>Cure/Cause Moderate Wounds: 2d8 (+1 per caster level, up to +10); Save vs. Spell for half damage</li>
            <li>Cure/Cause Medium Wounds: 3d8 (+1 per caster level, up to +15); Save vs. Spell for half damage</li>
            <li>Cure/Cause Serious Wounds: 4d8 (+1 per caster level, up to +20); Save vs. Spell for half damage</li>
            <li>Cure/Cause Critical Wounds: 5d8 (+1 per caster level, up to +25); Save vs. Spell for half damage</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li> Cure Wounds spells/abilities have a reverse effect on Undead, harming instead of healing them
          <ul>
            <li>For instance, Cure Light Wounds will deal 1d8 Magic damage if cast on an undead creature (Magic damage resistance of the targeted creature is ignored)</li>

        </li>
        <li> Cause Wounds spells/abilities have a reverse effect on Undead, healing instead of harming them

      <p> This component aims at implementing <abbr title="Pen and Paper">PnP</abbr> potion behavior.
        As a result, after installing this mod component, all in-game potions will behave as follows. Quaffing a potion while the effects of another potion are still active might trigger one of the following events:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> <em>1% chance to explode</em>
          <ul>
            <li>5d10 fire damage on the drinker, +1d10 fire damage in 5' radius (small fireball) (total of 6d10 on the drinker, no save).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li> <em>2% chance for instant poison death</em>
          <ul>
            <li>Unless the drinker is completely immune to poison damage.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li> <em>5% chance for Strength and Dexterity loss</em>
          <ul>
            <li>It will cause 1 Strength and 1 Dexterity loss (permanent, undispellable).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li> <em>7% chance to cancel/remove all active potion effects</em> </li>
        <li> <em>10% chance the current potion does nothing</em> </li>
        <li> <em>10% chance the current potion has -50% efficacy</em>
          <ul>
            <li>For instance, Potion of Magic Blocking would last for 15 seconds (instead of 30).</li>
            <li>For instance, Elixir of Health would heal the drinker for 5 Hit Points (instead of 10).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li> <em>8% chance the current potion has +50% efficacy</em>
          <ul>
            <li>For instance, Potion of Magic Blocking would last for 45 seconds (instead of 30).</li>
            <li>For instance, Elixir of Health would heal the drinker for 15 Hit Points (instead of 10).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li> <em>1% chance the current potion has +100% efficacy/permanent duration</em>
          <ul>
            <li>For instance, Potion of Magic Blocking would last indefinitely (until dispelled or removed by the &quot;7% chance to cancel/remove all active potion effects&quot; event).</li>
            <li>For instance, Elixir of Health would heal the drinker for 20 Hit Points (instead of 10).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p> Permanent potions, such as potions of healing, and potions that can end prematurely, such as Potion of Invisibility, would be considered still in effect for one turn (60 seconds) after drinking them.</p>
      <p> The aforementioned special events can occur only upon quaffing potions. As a result, there is no risk in using an Oil (e.g. Oil of Speed) and a Potion, as oils are applied to the skin, not consumed, so they wouldn't mix. </p>

      <p>This component aims at implementing the <abbr title="Pen and Paper">PnP</abbr> behavior of boars and bears.

      <p>Black bears are unaffected by this tweak. Spells such as Finger of Death or Power Word, Kill can still immediately slay the creature. </p>

      <p> Your reputation affects the prices of stores throughout the game; notably prices go down as reputation goes up and this component offers ways to change the mechanic. The original variant, <em>low reputation store discount [Sabre, Richardson, Weimer]</em>, is unchanged: reputation values of 8-13 result in no discounts; items are sold at their original prices. Every point lower or higher than 8 or 13, respectively, gives the party a 5% discount. This reaches a maximum of 35%&mdash;meaning that the party will only pay 65% of the item&#39;s original price&mdash;at reputation values of 1 and 20. </p>
      <p> Three new variants, courtesy of Luiz, remove the effect of reputation on storekeepers outright. The resulting prices can be set to 60%, 80%, or 100% of their listed values in general, but note that storekeepers will retain their original markups and buy discounts. </p>

      <p> Originally, this component made previously unsellable staves, clubs, and slings sellable for a single gold piece as well as restoring the Root of the Problem club to its original selling price from <abbr title="Baldur's Gate">BG</abbr>.

      <p> This component will modify merchants and stores to purchase all item types; e.g. Galoomp the Bookkeeper in <abbr title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</abbr> will now purchase armor, Oswald in <abbr title="Icewind Dale">IWD</abbr> will purchase more than just potions, &amp;c. This especially helps in places like <abbr title="Baldur's Gate">BG</abbr>&#39;s Beregost or <abbr title="Icewind Dale">IWD</abbr>&#39;s Kuldahar, where you have to cross the map repeatedly to visit multiple merchants to sell your latest loot. Some stores, such as Officer Vai, may have special markups to buy/sell items very close to their actual values. These stores are ignored by this component to avoid creating an exploitable, infinite-money cheat for high reputation/high charisma characters. </p>

      <p> This component will let you set individual minimum stats for all classes and kits. Minimum stats are a drawback in <abbr title="Pen and Paper">PnP</abbr>, but in <abbr title="Infinity Engine">IE</abbr> games it will simply re-roll a stat until it meets the minimum&mdash;essentially an unnatural boost to your dice rolls at character creation. This component will allow you to select a minimum stat value between 6 and 15 for each of the six stats individually (including no change). Note that at higher minimums, your flexibility in re-distributing the points can become more and more limited. Play around with the range to find minimums that work for you. </p>

      <p> In the standard game, the smith Taerom will buy all the ankheg shells the party has at one time, and will make only one set of Ankheg Armor. After it is completed, he will not even buy ankheg shells. This tweak changes this. He will now buy one shell at a time, and will again buy shells and make additional armor once the first is completed. Cost and time requirements still apply, and he can only make one at a time. Fenten in Baldur&#39;s Gate will also buy shells one at a time. </p>

      <p> One of <abbr title="Icewind Dale">IWD</abbr>&#39;s more fun aspects can also be one of its most frustrating: random drops. Various chests and creatures will pick an item from a list of possibilities once you enter their area, making certain powerful and unusual items unavailable in a given game&mdash;a common frustration is missing elven chain mail for bards. This component gives players some control over this process by letting them select from one of three options: </p>
      <ol>
        <li><em>Randomize on reload:</em> This option simply re-picks the random item whenever you reload or revisit an area, so you can stand beside a chest and mash quickload. </li>
        <li><em>Choose your drop:</em> The random items are replaced with tokens, which can be immediately exchanged for your choice of an item from the original table. </li>
        <li><em>Exchange with merchants:</em> This component will have the normal random drops when you travel through the world, but adds a merchant in Kuldahar and one in Lonelywood (if <abbr title="Heart of Winter">HoW</abbr> is installed). These merchants will allow you to exchange your items for another item in the table&mdash;for a commission, of course. </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Note that not every random drop is affected. Drops which  feature items available elsewhere&mdash;like the yeti chieftain dropping a random +1 weapon&mdash;are not randomized. </p>

      <p> This component tries to prevent &quot;chunking&quot;, the annoying permanent death of your character when you&#39;re reduced below -10 hp.

It isn&#39;t possible to prevent quite all forms of chunking (massive damage from fire, in particular, still seems to cause chunking fairly reliably), but this component should make it a less frequent occurrence. This may be useful in the later stages of the game, when melee opponents often do 30-40 hp damage per blow&mdash;that 10 hp safety margin starts to feel slender. </p>

      <p> UnderSigil is known as <em>the</em> map for grinding loot and experience. Since monsters are spawned randomly every time the area is revisited, the exploration state of the map can help to keep track of which parts have already been cleared. </p>

      <p>This component enables the creation of automatic saved games at specific points in the plot. It works similar to the chapter saves in Baldur's Gate. However, since <abbr title="Planescape: Torment">PsT</abbr> doesn't use chapters, the saves will instead be created at points that mark a special significance for the course of the plot.</p>
      <p>Saved games will be automatically created at the following points in the plot:</p>
      <ol>
        <li> At the beginning, after waking up in the Mortuary. </li>
        <li> When arriving at the Lower Ward for the first time. </li>

      <p>When traveling on the worldmap it was always frustrating that, after a 20-hour transit, only the character wearing a Ring of  Regeneration gets healed. A sensible party would pass the ring around to get everyone healed on such a long trip, the way a  player might swap items when walking across a map. </p>
      <p>This component will search for regeneration items above a certain threshold&mdash;currently set at 1 hp/9 seconds, enough to include  Rings of Regeneration&mdash;and, if the party is in possession, simply heals the party fully after any worldmap travel that isn't  instant. It's certainly not precise, as items which aren't usable by everyone get counted as regeneration items (e.g. Axe of  Unyielding), but that's why it's in the convenience/cheats section.</p>

      <p> This depressed elf mage has the lowest constitution in the game, giving him low survivability. Add to this a general lack of strong attack spells as an enchanter.

      <p> (There is a loophole here if <a href="https://github.com/Bubb13/EEex">EEex</a> is not installed: due to the way the game engine works, this actually allows all fighter-clerics (not just Yeslick) to use axes.

      <p> This component aims at implementing the <abbr title="Neverwinter Nights">NWN</abbr> feat Disarm.</p>
      <p>The character can attempt to disarm an opponent in melee combat. Attempting a disarm applies a -6 penalty to the character's attack roll, and the combatant with the larger weapon gains a +2 bonus per size category of difference. If the hit is successful, then the weapon flies from the opponent's hands.</p>
      <p> Notes: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use: selected, unlimited uses per day. Only available to rogues (starting from level 1; Intelligence 13 or higher).</li>
        <li>When the weapon flies from the opponent's hands, the attacker automatically picks it up (provided its Inventory is not full).</li>
        <li>This feat cannot be used while wielding a ranged weapon.</li>
        <li>The Disarm blow itself deals no damage and applies no on-hit effects (if any).</li>
        <li> As far as weapon sizes are concerned:
          <ul>
            <li>Small: unarmed fists, clubs, maces, slings, darts, daggers, short swords.</li>
            <li>Medium: battle axes, throwing axes, long swords, short bows, crossbows, morningstars, scimitars, war hammers.</li>
            <li>Large: bastard swords, katanas, halberds, staves, two-handed swords, spears, flails.</li>
            <li> Some examples:
              <ul>
                <li>if the attacker is wielding a dagger and the defender is wielding a katana, the size modifier is -4 (i.e., it's harder to succeed).</li>
                <li>if the attacker is wielding a katana and the defender is wielding a dagger, the size modifier is +4 (i.e., it's easier to succeed).</li>
                <li>if the attacker is wielding a dagger and the defender is wielding a short bow, the size modifier is -2 (i.e., it's harder to succeed).</li>
                <li>if the attacker is wielding a scimitar and the defender is wielding a dagger, the size modifier is +2 (i.e., it's easier to succeed).</li>
                <li>if the attacker is wielding a katana and the defender is wielding a katana, the size modifier is 0 (i.e., neutral).</li>

      <p>A character with this feat can attempt to knock his melee opponents to the ground. The character makes a special attack roll at -4, and if successful, the defender is knocked to a prone position.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use: selected, unlimited uses per day. Only available to fighters and monks (starting from level 1).</li>
        <li>The prone state lasts for one round.</li>
        <li>This feat cannot be used while wielding a ranged weapon.</li>
        <li>The Knockdown blow itself deals no damage and applies no on-hit effects (if any).</li>
        <li> A character can only make a knockdown attempt on opponents that are one size category larger than himself, or smaller.
          <ul>
            <li>As a rule of thumb, look at the defender's circle size: if smaller, equal or just a little bit bigger than the one of the attacker, then it is fine; otherwise, the creature is too large to be knocked down.</li>
            <li> if the attacker is larger than the defender, the attacker adds a +4 bonus to its roll (i.e., it's easier to succeed). Conversely, the attacker adds a -4 penalty to its roll if the defender is larger (i.e., it's harder to succeed). </li>

          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Creatures already on the ground (e.g. snakes, slimes, salamanders, &amp;c.), magically levitating creatures (beholders, demiliches, &amp;c.) and certain special creatures (e.g. spectral undead, elementals, dragons, &amp;c.) cannot be knocked down.</li>

      <p> This component aims at implementing the <abbr title="Neverwinter Nights">NWN</abbr> feat Spellcraft/Counterspell.
        Spellcraft is used to identify spells and to perform counterspells. A successful check means that your character has identified a spell being cast by an opponent </p>
      <p> Entering counterspell mode allows a caster to prevent an enemy caster from casting spells. This is done by first identifying the spell being cast (via Spellcraft), then sacrificing a readied spell slot containing a counter to the spell being cast. </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Spellcraft checks are automatic whenever a spell is cast nearby.
          <ul>
            <li>incapacitated characters cannot identify spells.</li>

                <li>if the character attempting to identify a spell being cast is deafened, there is an additional 50% chance of failure.</li>

            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li> Counterspell mode can be accessed via the Special Ability button.
          <ul>
            <li>You cannot cast more than one counterspell per round (regardless of Improved Alacrity).</li>
            <li>This is a combat mode, so cannot be used at the same time as other actions. Upon entering this mode, the character must remain idle. Any action other than counterspelling (i.e. the character is no longer idle) will end this mode.</li>
            <li>Counterspells have a casting time of 0 and cannot be disrupted (but can be blocked by the 5<sup>th</sup> level spell Spell Immunity).</li>
            <li>Silenced characters cannot perform counterspells.</li>
            <li>Dispel Magic/Remove Magic are universal counters (i.e., they can counter any spell of the same level or lower).</li>
            <li>Each spell is its own counter (i.e., a Magic Missile spell can counter a Magic Missile spell being cast).</li>
            <li> In all other cases:
              <ul>
                <li>Abjuration spells are countered by Illusion and Alteration spells.</li>

      <p> This component aims at giving clerics some Spontaneous Casting capabilities. Clerics will be able to spontaneously cast the &quot;cure&quot; and &quot;cause&quot; spells (from light to critical wounds), which will consume a readied spell slot of the appropriate level. </p>
      <p> As a completely artificial example, suppose a cleric has the following level 1 spells memorized: Armor of Faith, Armor of Faith, Bless. Even if Cure Light Wounds is missing, they will still be able to cast it! Upon casting it, all level 1 spells memorized will be decremented by one, meaning that they will end up with only Armor of Faith memorized (in other words, it can &quot;sacrifice&quot; one of the two Armor of Faith and Bless to spontaneously cast Cure Light Wounds).</p>
      <p> Spells that can be spontaneously cast can be accessed via pressing the Left Alt key while being in &quot;Cast Spell&quot; mode (F7 button). </p>
      <p> On top of that, note that: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>only good-aligned clerics can spontaneously cast the &quot;cure&quot; wounds spells</li>
        <li>only evil-aligned clerics can spontaneously cast the &quot;cause&quot; wounds spells</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As a result, neutral-aligned clerics are unaffected by this mechanic. </p>

Every time a thief is wielding a small blade (e.g. daggers, short swords, wakizashis, &amp;c.) or a club/mace, their <abbr title="To-Hit Armor Class 0">THAC0</abbr> will scale with Dexterity (as per the MISSILE column of <a href="https://gibberlings3.github.io/iesdp/files/2da/2da_bgee/dexmod.htm">dexmod.2da</a>) instead of Strength.</p>
      <p> As a completely artificial example, suppose a thief has 9 Strength and 18 Dexterity. Upon equipping a dagger, they will gain a <abbr title="To-Hit Armor Class 0">THAC0</abbr> bonus of 2 (instead of 0).

        <li>This feat is only available to thieves (level 10) and shadowdancers (level 5).</li>
        <li>A &quot;potentially lethal blow&quot; refers to a standard attack with a weapon that would, if not for this feat, reduce the target below one hit point with just its physical damage.</li>
        <li>Use: automatic, but limited to one use per 8 in-game hours. Incapacitated characters cannot make a defensive roll.</li>

      <p> This component also reworks the Called Shot ability. Here is the revised description: </p>
      <p>CALLED SHOT: Grants the ability to make a potentially disabling attack against an opponent's arms or legs. Called shots are made at a -4 penalty. A successful called shot against the legs reduces the opponent's movement rate by 20% and gives them a -2 cumulative penalty to their dexterity. A successful called shot against the arms applies a cumulative -2 penalty to the creature's attack rolls.</p>
      <p> So to sum up, its core features are now all built around the <em>bow</em> (instead of any missile weapon). </p>
      <p> Notes about Called Shot: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use: selected (unlimited uses per day, available from level 1).</li>
        <li>Successful called shots last four rounds.</li>
        <li>Called Shot (Legs) cannot drop Dexterity below 1.</li>
        <li>Called shots deal no damage and apply no on-hit effects (if any).</li>
        <li>Creatures without arms (e.g. slimes, beholders, wolves, spiders, &amp;c.) or legs (e.g. wyverns, imps, snakes, salamanders, &amp;c.) are unaffected by effects from Called Shot.</li>
      </ul>
      <p> Notes about Manyshot: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use: automatic.</li>
        <li>The two arrows are treated as one projectile (only one arrow is consumed).</li>
        <li>Both arrows use the same attack roll, but the second one cannot critical hit.</li>
        <li>If the attack roll hits, the target takes damage from both arrows. On-hit effects (if any) apply twice.</li>

      <p> This component aims at giving berserkers the Blind Fight feat. This feat grants the character the ability to fight well, even if blinded.

      <p> This component aims at implementing the <abbr title="Neverwinter Nights">NWN</abbr> feat Dirty Fighting. The character knows brutal and effective fighting tactics. During the first attack of each round, the character can elect to perform a dirty fighting move that will deal 5% of the target's maximum health as unmitigated damage.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use: automatic (available from level 1).</li>
        <li> Unmitigated damage means that damage resistance is ignored.
          <ul>
            <li>However, if the target's damage resistance is 100+, then it will be completely immune to the dirty fighting move.</li>

      <p> This component aims at giving trueclass fighters the passive feats Overwhelming/Devastating Critical. </p>
      <p> <em>Overwhelming Critical:</em> If the character is wielding a weapon with which they are a grandmaster they will deal an Overwhelming Critical, resulting in 3x damage on a successful critical hit (instead of 2x damage). Upon reaching level 30, critical hits become <em>Devastating Criticals</em>, forcing the character's target to make a Save vs. Death or die instantly (in addition to dealing 3x damage). </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use: automatic, but only available to trueclass fighters. 19+ Strength required.</li>
        <li> Creatures who are immune to critical hits are not affected by these feats.
          <ul>
            <li>However, they will still suffer 2x damage in case of Devastating Critical!</li>

        <em>EEex required; available for <abbr title="Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition">BGEE</abbr>, <abbr title="Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition">BG2EE</abbr>, <abbr title="Icewind Dale: Enhanced Edition">IWDEE</abbr>, <abbr title="Enhanced Edition Trilogy">EET</abbr></em></p>
      <p> This component aims at giving monks the passive feat Self Concealment. Concealment is a defensive trait that causes attacks to miss a certain percent of the time.
        So someone attacking a target with 25% concealment will miss a quarter of the time due to the concealment.
        This is applied independently of the attack roll; both the attack roll and the concealment roll are made for each attack, and only if the attacker succeeds at both the attack is successful.
        Concealment rolls are not themselves displayed on the screen, but if the roll fails, the attacker is told the attack failed because of concealment and is told the amount of concealment. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use: automatic, but only available to monks.</li>
        <li> Concealment does not stack. Only the highest concealment is used. The maximum concealment that a monk can have is 50% (level 30+).
          <ul>
            <li>Starts with 10% at level 10, and gains +10% every 5 levels thereafter.</li>
            <li>On top of that, the monk must also have at least 16 Dexterity. </li>

      <p>This component aims at implementing a Parry Mode for blades and swashbucklers. Parry allows the character to block incoming attacks and make spectacular counterattacks.
        A successful parry (save vs. Breath) means that the attack does not damage the parrying character. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use: selected (unlimited uses per day).</li>
        <li>Parry is a combat mode, so the character must remain idle while parrying attacks. Any other action will cancel the mode.</li>
        <li>Parry applies only in melee combat; it does not function if either the attacker or defender is using a ranged weapon.</li>
        <li> A character may only parry a number of attacks per round equal to the number of attacks per round available to the character.
          <ul>
            <li>1/2, 3/2, &amp;c. are rounded down/up (50% chance each). So if the parrying character has, say, 3/2 attacks per round, then it can parry a maximum of 1/2 attack(s) per round (50% chance each).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li> Riposte attacks automatically hit (the attacker must be within weapon range of the defender).
          <ul>
            <li>Bonus due to high Strength and on-hit effects apply as normal, but riposte attacks are not eligible for critical hit/miss.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>If the parrying character gets hit while performing a riposte attack, the riposte attack will be canceled.</li>
        <li>The higher Dexterity, the easier is to parry an incoming attack.
          <ul>
            <li>See the <code><abbr title="Armor Class">AC</abbr></code> column of <a href="https://gibberlings3.github.io/iesdp/files/2da/2da_bgee/dexmod.htm">dexmod.2da</a> to get an idea about how the roll scales with Dexterity.</li>
            <li>Rolling <code>20</code> will result in an automatic success.</li>
            <li>Rolling <code>1</code> will result in a critical failure.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>This combat mode cannot be used while polymorphed or while wielding a magically created weapon.</li>
        <li>Incapacitated characters cannot parry/perform riposte attacks.</li>
        <li>If the defender is equipped with fists, it can only parry other fists.</li>
        <li>If the parrying character is dual-wielding, the riposte attack will be made with the mainhand/offhand (50% chance each).</li>

      <p> This component reworks the Sneak Attack mechanic so as to make it more similar to the one in <abbr title="Neverwinter Nights">NWN</abbr> (sort of). To sum up:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use: automatic, but limited to once per round.</li>
        <li>Crippling Strike:
          <ul>
            <li>Assassins: the targeted creature must Save vs. Death at <code>-1 * (X - 1)</code> or be paralyzed for <code>Xd6</code> rounds (see <a href="https://gibberlings3.github.io/iesdp/files/2da/2da_bgee/crippstr.htm"><code>crippstr.2da</code></a> for the value of <code>X</code>).

This is cumulative, but cannot drop STR below 1.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

          <ul>
            <li>NB.: Barbarians will still be fully immune to them.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Additionally, even if enemies are not required to flank their target in order to perform a sneak attack, their target must still be flat-footed (i.e., the target must either be in combat with someone else or idle/helpless).</li>

      <ul>
        <li>You can access the Cantrips submenu by pressing the <code>Right Alt</code> key while being in &quot;Cast Spell&quot; mode (F7 button).</li>
        <li> The number of cantrips castable per day scales with the number of level 1 spells castable per day (minus 1; minimum 1).
          <ul>
            <li>For instance, a level 1 druid can only cast 1 cantrip per day.</li>
            <li>For instance, a level 12 druid can cast up to (6 - 1 = 5) cantrips per day.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Bards, rangers and paladins cannot cast cantrips.</li>
        <li> Since these spells are level 0 spells, they are automatically deflected/turned/trapped by Spell Deflection/Spell Turning/Spell Trap &amp;c.
          <ul>
            <li>In particular, note that if there are <code>X</code> levels left and a cantrip is cast at the wizard, the spell will be absorbed/turned/trapped while <u>not</u> decrementing <code>X</code>.</li>

      <p> This mod originally started when CamDawg and Idobek decided to combine their small tweak packs into a single mod, christened the <abbr title="The Gibberlings Three">G3</abbr> Tweak Pack and hosted at the (then brand-new) Gibberlings Three modding community. As Baldur&#39;s Gate Tutu gained in popularity, the <abbr title="The Gibberlings Three">G3</abbr> Tweak Pack was spun off into the Tutu Tweak Pack. As modding tools became more advanced and as conversion projects began to overlap the <abbr title="The Gibberlings Three">G3</abbr> and Tutu Tweak Packs were recombined and, with the permission of Wes Weimer, included the Ease-of-Use mod. This effort resulted in the <abbr title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</abbr> Tweak Pack. Once again, demand caused several spin off mods&mdash;the <abbr title="Icewind Dale">IWD</abbr> Tweak Pack, the <abbr title="Icewind Dale">IWD</abbr> Fixpack, the <abbr title="Icewind Dale II">IWD2</abbr> Tweak Pack, the <abbr title="Planescape: Torment">PsT</abbr> Tweak Pack, the <abbr title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</abbr> Tweak Pack, and the <abbr title="Icewind Dale">IWD</abbr>-in-<abbr title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</abbr> combo fixpack/tweak pack. Once again, technology has caught up, and all of these individual projects are once again being discontinued individually (save the <abbr title="Icewind Dale">IWD</abbr> Fixpack) and combined&mdash;hopefully for good this time&mdash;into a monolithic mod, the Tweaks Anthology. </p>
      <p> With such a convoluted history, we nonetheless strive to try and thank and acknowledge all those who contributed along the way and apologize profusely if we&#39;ve missed anyone. </p>
      <p> First, a big thanks to the wonderful community at <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/">The Gibberlings Three</a>. Many of the ideas leading to various components were suggested and/or improved by community involvement, and we hope to continue this collaboration. </p>
      <p> Big thanks to Wes Weimer, who gave us permission to incorporate Ease-of-Use. Ease-of-Use has many authors and contributors, and I have endeavored to credit them appropriately&mdash;if we&#39;ve overlooked someone or mis-credited their work, please let us know. In addition to Wes, Gebhard Blucher, Kevin Dorner (Baldurdash), jcompton, Schumacher, Kalthorine Ut Wistan, Karzak, Fred S. Richardson, and Sabre contributed to the old Ease-of-Use pack; translators for <abbr title="Ease-of-Use">EoU</abbr> were Antonio Favata, Thot, Bhasbuto of <a href="http://www.clandlan.net/">Clan DLAN</a>, and Marco Ivezic. </p>
      <p> Thanks to the authors that originally spun off the <abbr title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</abbr> Tweaks into a multitude of other platforms, made new components, and improvements to the old&mdash;all of which have found their way back into the Anthology. grogerson authored the <abbr title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</abbr> Tweak Pack; Andyr authored both the <abbr title="Planescape: Torment">PsT</abbr> and <abbr title="Icewind Dale">IWD</abbr> Tweak Packs, and the bigg wrote the <abbr title="Icewind Dale II">IWD2</abbr> Tweak Pack. DavidW, as part of the <abbr title="Icewind Dale">IWD</abbr>-in-<abbr title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</abbr> project, also produced the supplemental mod <abbr title="Icewind Dale">IWD</abbr>-in-<abbr title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</abbr> Fixpack/Tweak Pack, most of which has been absorbed here. </p>
      <p> Andyr was also kind enough to provide the Icewind Dale spell casting graphics and the Make Montaron an Assassin component. Thanks to the bigg, who provided the coding for the Maximum <abbr title="Hit Points">HP</abbr> For Non-Party-Joinable Creatures (now Maximum <abbr title="Hit Points">HP</abbr> Creatures) component. Thanks to icelus who provided code for Sellable Staffs, Clubs, and Slings (now Sellable Items). Thanks to Galactygon for the code for the Change Avatar When Wearing Robes or Armor component. Thanks to Domi for the Make Khalid a Fighter-Mage component. Thanks for Luiz for donating his Neutral Characters Make Happy Comments at Mid-Range Reputation and Change Effect of Reputation on Store Prices components. Thanks to Salk and Anomaly for variants of the Happy Patch. Thanks to Ardanis/GeN1e for the Trap Cap Removal, Remove Delay for Magical Traps, and Remove Summoning Cap for Celestials components. Thanks to jcompton for letting me scavenge the dialogue coding of <a href="http://www.pocketplane.net/npcflirt/"><abbr title="Non-Player Character">NPC</abbr> Flirt Pack</a> for the Romance Cheats component. Thanks to dark0dave for the Yoshimo to Imoen Experience Transfer and Better Shadows of Amn Start components. Thanks to argent77 for many, many components. </p>
      <p> Originally from the <abbr title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</abbr> Tweak Pack, a big thanks to Zed Nocear for his AreaCheck emulation, Portable Containers, Breakable Non-Magic Iron Armor, Shields and Helms, and the coding improvements for Send BioWare <abbr title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</abbr> to an Inn and Send Multi-Player <abbr title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</abbr> to an Inn. Thanks to plainab for providing his WIPT program for Make Magic Shields Glow, the streamlined code for the Friendly Arm Inn Container Restoration, and Change Cloakwood Mine Chapter End Trigger. </p>
      <p> From the <abbr title="Icewind Dale">IWD</abbr> Tweak Pack, a huge thank you for grogerson for his assistance, playtesting, bug reports, and suggestions, particularly for the second generation of this mod (v5 and above). Thanks also to Daulmakan and the various unnamed guests who helped report bugs and other issues. Thanks to the folks at <abbr title="The Gibberlings Three">G3</abbr> who contributed ideas for the various components. Thanks to icelus for contributing a few components, and Kaelas for the Talon of the Gloomfrost fix. Cheers to Petor23 and Da_Venom for help testing! Thanks also to guest Mike, grogerson, and Zed Nocear for insight into issues with the Wear Multiple Protection Items (<abbr title="Pen and Paper">PnP</abbr> Style) component. </p>
      <p> Unique Containers was originally a standalone mini-mod by Miloch. Thanks for that project go to DavidNowlin for the original idea and testing; Bursk, pro5 and SixOfSpades for troubleshooting; Aramis and Vedran for the Lost Items mod; Graoumf for the French translation, Leomar for the German translation; Stoneangel and Andrea/ilot for the Italian translation; prowler and aerie.ru for the Russian translation; and Ancalagon el Negro and Immortality for the Spanish translation. </p>
      <p> Versions 7-10 of <abbr title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</abbr> Tweaks owe a lot to the community who picked it up and made several updates: DavidW, Mike1072, berelinde, Wisp, and aVENGER. </p>
      <p>In addition to his many other contributions throughout the mod, Luke single-handedly added the entire <abbr title="Neverwinter Nights">NWN</abbr>-Style Feats section, and it's spectacular. </p>
      <p> Thanks to the folks at <abbr title="The Gibberlings Three">G3</abbr> who contributed ideas for the various components. Thank you as well to our translators: </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Tweaks Anthology now has a batch installer; see the <a href="#contents_batch">relevant section</a> of the readme for details. </li>
        <li>Updated the Russian, French, Spanish, Italian, and Chinese translations</li>
        <li>Version 17 is the largest expansion of the Anthology.
          <ul>
            <li>Luke leveraged the expanded possibilities of EEex on the <abbr title="Enhanced Editions">EEs</abbr>, creating an entire new section of the mod, <a href="#contents_feats"><abbr title="Neverwinter Nights">NWN</abbr>-Style Feats</a>: <strong>Disarm Class Feat for Rogues</strong>, <strong>Knockdown Class Feat for Fighters and Monks</strong>, <strong>Spellcaster Skill/Counterspell Class Talent</strong>, <strong>Spontaneous Casting for Clerics, Weapon Finesse Class Feat for Thieves, Dual-Wield Class Feat for Rangers, <abbr title="Neverwinter Nights">NWN</abbr>-Style Armor vs. Dexterity, Defensive Roll Class Feat for Thieves, Divine Grace/Dark Blessing Feat for Paladins/Blackguards, Good Aim Racial Feat for Halflings, Cleave Class Feat for Fighters and Monks, Sneak Attack Class Feat for Blackguards, Fearless Racial Feat for Halflings, Poison Save Class Feat for Assassins, Planar Turning Class Feat for Clerics/Paladins, Circle Kick Class Feat for Monks, <abbr title="Neverwinter Nights">NWN</abbr>-Style Barbarian Rage, &quot;Force&quot; the Archer Kit to Use Bows, Blind Fight Innate Feat for Berserkers, Dirty Fighting Class Feat for Chaotic-Aligned Rogues, Overwhelming/Devastating Critical Class Feat for Trueclass Fighters, Self Concealment Class Feat for Monks, Parry Mode Kit Feat for Blades and Swashbucklers, Armored Caster Class Feat for Bards, Trackless Step Class Feat for Rangers, Nature Sense Class Feat for Druids, Uncanny Dodge Class Feat for Barbarians and Rogues, <abbr title="Neverwinter Nights">NWN</abbr>-Style Sneak Attack/Crippling Strike Class Feat for Thieves and Stalkers, </strong><strong>Evasion Class Feat for Thieves and Monks</strong>, <strong>Spell Penetration Class Feat for Spellcasters</strong>, <strong>Smite Evil/Good Class Feat for Paladins/Blackguards</strong>, <strong>Woodland Stride Class Feat for Druids</strong>, <strong>Bane of Enemies Class Feat for Rangers</strong>, <strong>Cantrips for Spellcasters</strong>, <strong>Animal Companion Class Feat for Beastmasters</strong>, and <strong>Opportunist Class Feat for Chaotic-Aligned Rogues</strong>.</li>
            <li>In addition to the massive expansion above, Luke also contributed <strong><abbr title="Pen and Paper">PnP</abbr> Potions, More Sensible Cowled Wizards, Hide Visual Effects from Invisible Enemies, More Stoneskin Feedback,</strong> <strong>Improved Cure/Cause Wounds</strong>, <strong>Make Grease Ignitable</strong>, <strong>Make Bears and Boars Continue Fighting after Reaching 0 Hit Points</strong>, <strong>Limit Resting Mechanic</strong>, <strong>Make Infravision Useful</strong>, <strong>Alternate Concentration Checks</strong>, <strong>Revised Troll Regeneration</strong>,<strong> More Sensible Fireshield</strong>, <strong>More Sensible Blade Barrier</strong>, <strong>Dynamic FPS Change</strong>, <strong>More Sensible Morentherene</strong>, <strong><abbr title="Neverwinter Nights">NWN</abbr>-Style Summons</strong>, and <strong>Make Rancor +1 a Bit More Reliable. </strong></li>
            <li>argent77  added <strong>Automatic &quot;Chapter Saves&quot; in <abbr title="Planescape: Torment">PsT</abbr>:<abbr title="Enhanced Edition">EE</abbr>, Restored Loading Hints,</strong> <strong>Automatic Transition to the Heart of Winter Expansion</strong>, <strong>Static <abbr title="Planescape: Torment">PsT</abbr> Character Portraits</strong>, and <strong>Colorize <abbr title="Non-Player Character">NPC</abbr> Names and Tooltips</strong></li>
            <li> CamDawg added <strong>Sensible Regeneration When Traveling</strong>, <strong>Automatic Use of Ranger Tracking Skill</strong>, <strong>Outline White Spell Icons for Accessibility</strong>, <strong>Explicit Cast Warnings, </strong><strong>Karoug Weapon Vulnerability Adjustments</strong>, and <strong>Allow Monks to Change Damage Types with Hand Weapons</strong></li>
            <li>First time contributor dark0dave added <strong>Yoshimo to Imoen Experience Transfer</strong> and <strong>Better Shadows of Amn Start</strong> </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Fixes/Improvements:
          <ul>
            <li>The component to remove the experience cap also tries to extend kit ability tables to level 50, if they don't already extend that far. The algorithm to extend the tables has been adjusted to (hopefully) capture the 'one use per X levels' abilities better. </li>
            <li> <strong>Reveal City Maps When Entering Area</strong> now works on <abbr title="Enhanced Edition Trilogy">EET</abbr>. By necessity this component also fixes a script loop for an area in <abbr title="Baldur's Gate">BG</abbr> proper on <abbr title="Original Baldur's Gate">oBG</abbr>/Tutu games but due to a bad logic check it was not being applied</li>
            <li><strong>Restore <abbr title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</abbr> Load Screen Logo</strong> would not work on a few edge cases and has been fixed</li>
            <li>Revamped the <strong>Gradual Drow Item Disintegration</strong> component, and also made it better account for <abbr title="Enhanced Edition">EE</abbr> changes</li>
            <li>Added two variants to <strong>Breakable Iron Non-Magical Shields, Helms, and Armor</strong> to allow armor to gradually degrade rather than just break. Streamlined helmet breakage to be more robust by no longer requiring any scripting and fixed a bug where items could break in the Black Pits campaign. </li>
            <li>The <strong>Mutliple Strongholds</strong> component could add duplicate replies to Nalia's dialogue on <abbr title="Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition">BG2EE</abbr>/<abbr title="Enhanced Edition Trilogy">EET</abbr> games</li>
            <li><strong>Multiple Strongholds</strong> also has some fixes for the druid grove. Faldorn only used her abilities when facing a druid in solo combat so she now uses them on everyone. The changes to make the grove available to everyone was not removing the block for shamans</li>
            <li> <abbr title="Planescape: Torment">PsT</abbr> items are now better handled by the various stacking tweaks; most notably charms are now handled by <strong>Increase Potion Stacking</strong> instead of <strong>Increase Jewelry, Gem, and Miscellaneous Item Stacks</strong></li>
            <li>Fixed a potential issue where the <strong>Separate Resist Fire/Cold Icon into Separate Icons</strong> component would leave the original icons instead of just replacing them</li>
            <li><strong>Increase Party Movement Speed and/or Casting Speed Outside of Combat</strong> could sometimes not clear haste during combat. In addition there are also now more options for this component available in the customization text file, cdtweaks.txt. </li>
            <li><strong>Alter Weapon Proficiency System</strong> had a couple of fixes:
              <ul>
                <li>It could double-apply a racial bonus with ranged weapons by e.g. applying the bonus to a bow and also to an arrow. </li>
                <li> Weapons which provide their own bonus to use (e.g. Black Blade of Disaster) were not being updated to the new proficiencies. </li>
                <li>The <abbr title="Baldur's Gate">BG</abbr> and <abbr title="Icewind Dale">IWD</abbr> options now have better, more accurate, more consistent proficiency descriptions. </li>
                <li>For the <abbr title="Icewind Dale">IWD</abbr> option, existing flail profs could be mapped to halberd</li>
                <li>The new proficiencies that include spears will now mention javelins if <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/mods/items/project_javelin/">Project Javelin</a> is installed</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Fixed a small error in <strong>Personalize Automatic Save Names</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Proficiency Rules on Dual-Classed Characters</strong> was giving fighter/mages an extra spell on every level</li>
            <li><strong>Alter Hostile Rest Spawns</strong> could fail on area files with unusual structure; this is now better identified and handled</li>
            <li>Fixed a dialogue loop in <strong>Make Khalid a Fighter-Mage</strong> (thanks jastey). Khalid's name was also wrong if he was spawned in <abbr title="Siege of Dragonspear">SoD</abbr>. </li>
            <li><strong>Unique Icons</strong> was miscoloring one of the plumed helmets by applying coloring meant for the plume to the helmet instead</li>
            <li>Freedom is now excepted from <strong>Level-Locked Spell Scrolls</strong> because it could otherwise screw over a party</li>
            <li> <strong>Faster Chapter One and Two Cutscenes and Dreams </strong>could miss patching a script on <abbr title="Original Baldur's Gate II">oBG2</abbr>. It's also now available for <abbr title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</abbr> and <abbr title="Enhanced Edition Trilogy">EET</abbr> games. </li>
            <li><strong>Rest Anywhere</strong> wasn't targeting the correct area bits on some platforms</li>
            <li> <strong>Allow <abbr title="Non-Player Character">NPC</abbr> Pairs to Separate</strong> now works for <abbr title="Non-Player Character">NPC</abbr> pairs in <abbr title="Siege of Dragonspear">SoD</abbr> (Khalid/Jaheira and Minsc/Dynaheir)</li>
            <li>Harrold's dialogue in <strong>Friendly Random Drops</strong> &gt; <em>Exchange with merchants</em> is copied and updated from Flynn's dialogue, but due to a code typo several references were not being updated correctly. Also fixed an issue where the third level Dragon's Eye drop could be blank because the component was  providing stacks of 0 for the ammo that could drop. </li>
            <li>During the original three Bio romances for males (Aerie, Jaheira, Viconia) they snipe at each other during LTs and eventually  force a decision on the player of which romance to pursue. Surprisingly, these were never disabled by the <em>Allow multiple romances</em> option of <strong>Romance Cheats</strong>. The altercations will still occur, but all of the romances will still continue. </li>
            <li><strong>Two-Handed Axes</strong> could have minor errors if Braegar was installed due to the compatibility code</li>
            <li><strong>Maximum <abbr title="Hit Points">HP</abbr> Creatures</strong> now accounts for the non-standard dice sizes of Dwarven Defenders (d12) and Dragon Disciples (d6). It will also roll through level 20 if <strong>Allow <abbr title="Hit Points">HP</abbr> Rolls Through Level 20</strong> is installed</li>
            <li><strong>Everyone Gets Bonus <abbr title="Attacks Per Round">APR</abbr> from Specialization</strong> was not providing <abbr title="Attacks Per Round">APR</abbr> bonuses to monks or non-joinable <abbr title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</abbr></li>
            <li>Fixed an issue with <strong>More Interjections</strong> that would occur specifically on reinstalls</li>
            <li>Added a config option for <strong>Maximum <abbr title="Hit Points">HP</abbr> Creatures</strong> to change the percentage or add a flat bonus</li>
            <li>The various components that change druids to use cleric <abbr title="Experience Points">XP</abbr> progression didn't work on <abbr title="Icewind Dale: Enhanced Edition">IWDEE</abbr> due to bad whitespace detection. </li>
            <li><strong>No Traps or Locks</strong> now has two more variants to better refine which traps to remove</li>
            <li>Khalid and Jaheira could leave permanently if sent to the <abbr title="Friendly Arm Inn">FAI</abbr> with <strong>Send BioWare <abbr title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</abbr> to an Inn</strong> on <abbr title="Original Baldur's Gate">oBG</abbr> or Tutu games</li>
            <li><strong>Increase Party Movement Speed and/or Casting Speed Outside of Combat</strong> now uses a custom portrait icon for its haste effects, added a customization config option, and slightly updated its in-game text</li>
            <li><strong>Allow Monks to Wear Helmets</strong> has been renamed to <strong>Expand Usable Monk Equipment</strong>, as it now allows monks to use staves, helmets, or both. </li>
            <li>A dialogue fix for the NORH, as part of <strong>Multiple Strongholds</strong>, was being executed as part of the de'Arnise Keep changes</li>
            <li><strong>Move <abbr title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</abbr> to Convenient Locations</strong> now has a 'move everyone' option. Also fixed a small bit of Alora's dialogue breaking immutability. </li>
            <li>The <abbr title="Icewind Dale">IWD</abbr> options of the <strong>Alter Paladin Spell Progression Table</strong> and <strong>Alter Ranger Spell Progression Table</strong> lower the level where these classes get their first spell; however their caster levels are still pegged to when they used to get their first spell. Their caster levels are now adjusted to match. </li>
            <li><strong>Weapon Animation Tweaks</strong> will no longer change morningstars to use the mace animation. </li>
            <li>Items created by <strong>Two-Handed X</strong> and <strong>Wear Multiple Protection Items</strong> &gt; <em><abbr title="Pen and Paper">PnP</abbr> restrictions</em> will no longer get charges drained by creatures like nishruu or magic golems</li>
            <li>Added a 'dual-class adjustment' config option for loosening equipment restrictions as part of the <strong>Change Equipment Restrictions for Druid Multi- and Dual-Classes</strong> component</li>
            <li>Some of the components that use a weapon's animation to determine what kind of weapon it is&mdash;such as <strong>Weapon Animation Tweaks</strong>&mdash;weren't  properly accounting for the new animation styles introduced in One Pixel Productions and the Enhanced Editions</li>
            <li> <strong>Change Cloakwood Mine Chapter End Change Trigger to Non-<abbr title="Tales of the Sword Coast">TotSC</abbr> Behavior [plainab]</strong> was not clearing one journal entry on <abbr title="Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition">BGEE</abbr>/<abbr title="Enhanced Edition Trilogy">EET</abbr> games</li>
            <li><strong>Alter Druid Spell and Level Progression Tables</strong> now offers two new progressions for druid <abbr title="Experience Points">XP</abbr>, based on the normal <abbr title="Icewind Dale">IWD</abbr> and <abbr title="Baldur's Gate">BG</abbr>/<abbr title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</abbr> <abbr title="Experience Points">XP</abbr> progression</li>
            <li>The <strong>Avatar Morphing Script</strong> will now work for monk if their default animation has been changed to a cleric, e.g. if allowing monks to use staves via the <strong>Expand Usable Monk Equipment</strong> component</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Mod conflict issues:
          <ul>
            <li>A number of updates for <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/mods/fixes/eefp/"><abbr title="Enhanced Edition">EE</abbr> Fixpack</a> compatibility</li>
            <li><strong>Increase Jewelry, Gem, and Miscellaneous Item Stacks</strong> could interfere with a critical item from Throne of Mad God, so that specific item is no longer altered</li>
            <li>Resolved a potential conflict between the <strong>Friendly Random Drops</strong> component and <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/mods/fixes/iwd_fixpack/"><abbr title="Icewind Dale">IWD</abbr> Fixpack</a></li>
            <li>A couple of components within Anthology would conflict if they were installed out of the order they are presented in the installer. These conflicts have been resolved between <strong>Send BioWare <abbr title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</abbr> to an Inn</strong> and <strong>More Interjections; </strong><strong>Disable Portrait Icons Added by Equipped Items</strong> and <strong>Separate Resist Fire/Cold Icon into Separate Icons</strong>; all of the <strong>Two-Handed X</strong> components and the variants of <strong>Alter Weapon Proficiency System</strong>; the cleric <abbr title="Experience Points">XP</abbr> variants of the <strong>Alter Druid Spell and Level Progression Tables</strong> and the <strong>Change Experience Point Cap</strong> components</li>
            <li><strong>Use <abbr title="Baldur's Gate">BG</abbr> Walking Speeds</strong> will now apply to <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/mods/npcs/grey-the-dog/">Grey the Dog</a></li>
            <li><strong>Taerom Makes Additional Ankheg Armors</strong> will now skip if the same component from Tweaks and Tricks is installed</li>
            <li>Resolved a conflict between <strong>Allow Arcane Spellcasting in Heavy Armor</strong> and Artisan's Eldritch Knight and Bardic Wonders. Both had an option for armored casting but were still receiving miscast penalties; these penalties no longer apply</li>
            <li>Two druid helmets added by DSotSC were being made unusable by <strong>Change Equipment Restrictions for Druid Multi- and Dual-Classes</strong></li>
            <li>Various components now account better for the updated <abbr title="Icewind Dale II">IWD2</abbr> Ease-of-Use mod and the new <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/mods/tweaks/tof/">Talents of Faer&ucirc;n</a> mod, mainly by skipping if functionally similar components are already installed</li>
            <li>The various two-handed items created by the <strong>Two-Handed X</strong> components are no longer usable by <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/mods/npcs/amber/">Amber</a> as she refuses to use two-handed weapons</li>
            <li> <strong>Add Map Notes</strong> will now account for changes from <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/mods/quests/thecalling/">The Calling</a> to the Gnoll Stronghold</li>
            <li><strong>Thieves Can Backstab With More Weapons With &quot;Use Any Item&quot; or as Dual- and Multi-Classes</strong> now accounts for the Staff of the Gorgon from <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/mods/kits/spc/">SP Collection</a></li>
            <li>Resolved a conflict between <strong>Friendly Random Drops</strong> and the <abbr title="Icewind Dale: Enhanced Edition">IWDEE</abbr>-specific Item Tweaks component from SubtleD's Item Tweaks </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Internal stuff:
          <ul>
            <li>Exchanges for <strong>Friendly Random Drops</strong> &gt; <em>Exchange with merchants</em> are now flagged in dialogue as 'execute immediately' in the <abbr title="Enhanced Editions">EEs</abbr></li>
            <li>Upgraded to a custom variant of k4thos's joinable <abbr title="Non-Player Character">NPC</abbr> detection for more reliable detection of joinable <abbr title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</abbr>. All components which had to distinguish between joinables vs. non-joinables now uses the new code. </li>
            <li>Standardized and updated multiple libraries as part of an internal re-organization process</li>
            <li><strong>Unique Containers</strong> has a rash of fixes for bags from other mods; the code targeting bags from Unfinished Business was removed as the mod fixed these issues a while back</li>
            <li><strong>Death Cam</strong>'s Easter egg wasn't working</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p> <a id="history_16" name="history_16"></a><strong>Version 16 - October 13, 2022</strong> <a href="#history_16" rel=""><img alt="Link to this history" height="9" width="14" src="style/link.png" /></a></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Added the <strong>Make Certain Creatures Immune to Backstab/Sneak Attack [Luke]</strong> component, courtesy of Luke</li>
        <li><strong>Remove Helmet Animations</strong> was not removing helmets for clerics on <abbr title="Enhanced Edition">EE</abbr> games</li>
        <li>Realized that <span data-code-marker="-"><strong>Thieves Can Backstab With More Weapons With &quot;Use Any Item&quot;</strong></span> would also apply to dual- and multi-class thieves, so the component was made available on more games and renamed <span data-code-marker="+"><strong>Thieves Can Backstab With More Weapons With &quot;Use Any Item&quot; or as Dual- and Multi-Classes</strong></span></li>
        <li>Updated the Russian and French translations</li>
        <li><strong><abbr title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</abbr> Don't Fight</strong> stops the Korgan-Aerie fight by blocking the entire series of banters that leads to the confrontation. The component now only blocks the final banter that forces the split. </li>
        <li>Updated <strong>Unique Icons [Lava] </strong>and <strong>Unique Containers [Miloch]</strong> to account for a few more mod versions of items</li>
        <li><strong>Increase Party Movement Speed and/or Casting Speed Outside of Combat [argent77]</strong> will now provide a name/description for these abilities; the portrait icon associated with this will now more accurately reflect the player's selection</li>
        <li> <strong>Add Bags of Holding</strong> added a Bag of Holding to Ribald, but this was not mentioned in the docs. The two variants of <strong>Unique Icons [Lava]</strong> are also better delineated. </li>
        <li><strong> Change Jaheira to Neutral Good Alignment</strong> could throw a warning due to an old GAME_IS check</li>
        <li>Components which update item descriptions (e.g. the <strong>Two-Handed X</strong> components) would try to update a description if the item had a  string reference in a valid range without checking to see if the string actually existed in the tlk table. This resulted in items getting descriptions of '&lt;Invalid strref XXX&gt;'. These fields are no longer altered unless both the string reference and string contents are valid. </li>
        <li>Under-Represented Items and Item Upgrade items have been added to the static item lists for the <strong>Two-Handed X</strong> components and the <em><abbr title="Pen and Paper">PnP</abbr> restrictions</em> variant of <strong>Wear Multiple Protection Items </strong> </li>
        <li>A number of components had minor issues on <abbr title="Original Icewind Dale">oIWD</abbr> games, due to not the slightly different file formats: the <strong>Two-Handed X</strong> components, <strong>Increase Jewelry, Gem, and Miscellaneous Item Stacks, </strong><strong>Increase Scroll Stacking</strong>, and the <em><abbr title="Pen and Paper">PnP</abbr> restrictions</em> variant of <strong>Wear Multiple Protection Items </strong></li>
        <li>Fixed a bug where needed variables would not be set in passive install scenarios (Anthology gets automatically reinstalled because a mod earlier in the order gets updated/removed), causing Anthology components to fail to re-install</li>
        <li>Fixed bug with <strong>Everyone Gets Bonus <abbr title="Attacks Per Round">APR</abbr> from Specialization [subtledoctor]</strong> where it could grant an erroneous half-attack for characters when imported between games, notably from <abbr title="Baldur's Gate">BG</abbr> to <abbr title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</abbr></li>
        <li>Compatibility fixes for Auril's Bane 1.7. This mod ships with a number of mis-indexed and/or broken files which can cause various Anthology components to fail. If AB is detected, Anthology will silently fix these issues. </li>
        <li>Another round of fixes for <strong>Send BioWare <abbr title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</abbr> to an Inn</strong>. Specifically, Neera and Rasaad could still leave for their normal locations if <strong>More Interjections</strong> was installed. Also, the option to send Neera to the <abbr title="Friendly Arm Inn">FAI</abbr> would sometimes do nothing. </li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>New components:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Remove &quot;+x&quot; From Unique Item Names</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Alter Wisdom-Based Divine Bonus Spell Table</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Thieves Can Backstab With More Weapons With &quot;Use Any Item&quot;</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Restore <abbr title="Icewind Dale">IWD</abbr> Tooltips</strong></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Updated French translation, courtesy of mickabouille</li>
        <li>Updated Russian translation, courtesy of yota13 and <a href="https://arcanecoast.ru/">arcanecoast.ru</a></li>
        <li>Fixed an issue with text encoding, which could cause messed-up characters to appear for non-English players</li>
        <li><strong> Remove Helmet Animations</strong> now remove helmet animations in a substantially cleaner fashion on <abbr title="Enhanced Edition">EE</abbr> games. This was also used for <strong>Allow Monks to Wear Helmets</strong> so that human monk animations can still be used whether or not <strong>Remove Helmet Animations</strong> is installed (on the <abbr title="Enhanced Editions">EEs</abbr>, at least)</li>
        <li>Addressed minor incompatibility between <strong>Remove Racial Restrictions for Single Classes</strong> and <strong>The Artisan's Kitpack</strong>, in that the former would overwrite the custom half-orc monk paperdoll from the latter</li>
        <li> The <strong>Universal Clubs</strong> component was looking along the wrong path for translation files, meaning most clubs did not get their descriptions properly updated</li>
        <li> <strong>Increase Party Movement Speed and/or Casting Speed Outside of Combat [argent77]</strong> should have better detection for pseudo-party members such as familiars or 'companion' <abbr title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</abbr></li>
        <li>Fixed  bad shadows on the new icons for the Magma Bulwark and the Ring of Human Influence as part of <strong> Unique Icons [Lava] </strong></li>
        <li><strong>Unique Icons [Lava] </strong>now has the option to override existing, unique icons or to preserve them</li>
        <li>Fixed a bug with the <strong>Friendly Random Drops</strong> component, specifically, the <em>Choose your drop</em> variant. The handful of random items that were actually wielded by enemies were being swapped, but done in such a way that the enemy was not dropping a token and also attacking barehanded. </li>
        <li><strong>Send BioWare <abbr title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</abbr> to an Inn</strong> was still allowing Neera and Rasaad to depart as normal</li>
        <li> <strong><abbr title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</abbr> Don't Fight</strong> will now prevent having to choose between Rasaad and Viconia in Rasaad's Throne of Bhaal quest</li>
        <li> <strong>Adjust Cromwell's Forging Time</strong> was adjusting the time correctly on <abbr title="Enhanced Edition">EE</abbr> games, but it would default back to the original time if the forging cutscene was skipped by the player</li>
      </ul>
      <p> <a id="history_14" name="history_14"></a><strong>Version 14 - April 5, 2022</strong> <a href="#history_14" rel=""><img alt="Link to this history" height="9" width="14" src="style/link.png" /></a></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Just an embarrassingly dumb copy-paste meant that <strong>Unique Icons [Lava]</strong> was not doing anything on <abbr title="Baldur's Gate">BG</abbr>/<abbr title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</abbr> games. </li>
      </ul>
      <p> <a id="history_13" name="history_13"></a><strong>Version 13 - April 4, 2022</strong> <a href="#history_13" rel=""><img alt="Link to this history" height="9" width="14" src="style/link.png" /></a></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Instead of grabbing icons from other games, <strong>Unique Icons</strong> now features over 330 beautiful new icons from Lava and has been re-designated <strong>Unique Icons [Lava]</strong>. Check out the <a href="https://gibberlings3.github.io/Documentation/readmes/readme-cdtweaks_unique_icons.html">new documentation</a> to see all of the changes. </li>
        <li>Updates to the Polish and Russian translations, courtesy of m-architek and abalabokhin</li>
        <li>Fixed a bug where a couple of components interacted badly with malformed kit ability tables</li>
        <li>Fixed a couple of bugs with <strong>Friendly Random Drops</strong>; specifically a few drops were being missed due to a combination of factors</li>
        <li>Fixed a bug with the <strong>Send BioWare <abbr title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</abbr> to an Inn</strong> on <abbr title="Enhanced Edition Trilogy">EET</abbr>; specifically the component was patching the <abbr title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</abbr> dialogues of the <abbr title="Enhanced Edition">EE</abbr> <abbr title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</abbr> instead of their <abbr title="Baldur's Gate">BG</abbr> dialogues</li>
        <li>Updated the master armor list with an update to Grumbar's Defense </li>
      </ul>
      <p> <a id="history_12" name="history_12"></a><strong>Version 12 - March 10, 2022</strong> <a href="#history_12" rel=""><img alt="Link to this history" height="9" width="14" src="style/link.png" /></a></p>
      <ul>
        <li> Mangled the Polish translation during conversion; AL|EN fixed this plus a minor regexp bug </li>
        <li> <strong>Universal Clubs</strong> was not allowing sorcerer kits (e.g. Dragon Disciple) to put a weapon proficiency point in clubs </li>
      </ul>
      <p> <a id="history_11" name="history_11"></a><strong>Version 11 - March 9, 2022</strong> <a href="#history_11" rel=""><img alt="Link to this history" height="9" width="14" src="style/link.png" /></a></p>
      <ul>
        <li> Updated Italian and Russian translations thanks to improb@bile and abalabokhin, respectively </li>
        <li> Many improvements for <strong>Unique Icons</strong>: it now has its own, substantially improved <a href="https://gibberlings3.github.io/Documentation/readmes/readme-cdtweaks_unique_icons.html">documentation</a>; it&#39;s been extended to cover the <abbr title="Baldur's Gate">BG</abbr> portion of the game; Lava has graciously given us new, unique icons for the <abbr title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</abbr> items from the &#39;bonus merchants&#39;, Joluv and Deidre </li>
        <li> Fixed a bug with <strong>Enforce <abbr title="Pen and Paper">PnP</abbr> Proficiency Rules on Dual-Classed Characters </strong>where it would display the summoning puff of smoke on level-ups, and (on <abbr title="Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition">BGEE</abbr>) play a random Imoen dialogue line </li>
        <li> <strong>Make +x/+y Weapons Consistent</strong> was available for all games, but it should only be available for <abbr title="Original Baldur's Gate II">oBG2</abbr>/<abbr title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</abbr> games without the <abbr title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</abbr> Fixpack </li>
        <li> Changed the way the mod handles character sets for non-English installs. This is an internal change to make development smoother and should not affect players. </li>
      </ul>
      <p> <a id="history_10" name="history_10"></a><strong>Version 10 - February 7, 2022</strong> <a href="#history_10" rel=""><img alt="Link to this history" height="9" width="14" src="style/link.png" /></a></p>
      <ul>
        <li> <strong>Weapon Styles for All</strong> will now account for monk and sorcerer kits </li>
        <li> Fixed the messed up encoding with the French translation; updated further by Jazira33 </li>
        <li> Took yet another pass at fixing the last few issues with <strong>Send BioWare <abbr title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</abbr> to an Inn [DavidW/Zed Nocear]</strong> and <strong>Allow <abbr title="Non-Player Character">NPC</abbr> Pairs to Separate</strong> on <abbr title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</abbr> </li>
        <li> Fixed issue with Imoen specifically with <strong><abbr title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</abbr>-Style <abbr title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</abbr></strong> when Ascension is installed. Thanks to Bartimaeus for tracking this down! </li>
        <li> <strong>Unique Icons</strong> will now adjust item coloring on the avatar and paperdoll to match the item&#39;s new icon. A few icons were also updated (thanks TotoR) and cover some Ascension versions of items </li>
        <li> <strong>Add Bags of Holding</strong> will now allow formerly unsellable items into the bags on original <abbr title="Icewind Dale">IWD</abbr>. A regular Bag of Holding has been added to Shadows of Amn. </li>
        <li> <strong>Friendly Random Drops</strong> was adjusted to account for the small placement change in <abbr title="Icewind Dale">IWD</abbr> Fixpack v7 </li>
        <li> <strong>Increase Jewelry, Gem, and Miscellaneous Item Stacks</strong> now covers goodberries </li>
        <li> The static armor lists have been expanded to cover EEEE </li>
        <li> The bearweres added by <strong>Shapeshifter Rebalancing</strong> always used the polar bear animation. They&#39;ll now use the bearwere animation from Infinity Animations, if available, otherwise the bearweres will use polar bear animations for <abbr title="Icewind Dale">IWD</abbr>-series games or cave bears for <abbr title="Baldur's Gate">BG</abbr>-series games. </li>
        <li> TotoR added an alternative, <abbr title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</abbr>-style spell progression table for rangers and paladins. As such <strong>Paladins Use <abbr title="Icewind Dale">IWD</abbr>-<abbr title="Heart of Winter">HoW</abbr> Spell Progression Tables</strong> and <strong>Rangers Use <abbr title="Icewind Dale">IWD</abbr>-<abbr title="Heart of Winter">HoW</abbr> Spell Progression Tables</strong> have been renamed to <strong>Alter Paladin Spell Progression Table</strong> and <strong>Alter Ranger Spell Progression Table</strong>, respectively, and players can choose between the <abbr title="Heart of Winter">HoW</abbr> tables and TotoR&#39;s new alternatives. </li>
        <li> <strong>Accelerate/Decelerate Romances</strong> was not quite catching and adjusting all of the romance timer, especially for the <abbr title="Enhanced Edition">EE</abbr> <abbr title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</abbr>. It&#39;s also been extended to cover the pseudo-romances of the <abbr title="Enhanced Edition">EE</abbr> <abbr title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</abbr> in <abbr title="Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition">BGEE</abbr>. </li>
        <li> <strong><abbr title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</abbr> Don&#39;t Fight</strong> will now prevent Edwin and Neera from making their &#39;them or me&#39; ultimatums so that they can be in the party together. </li>
      </ul>
      <p> <a id="history_10rc1" name="history_10rc1"></a><strong>Version 10 Release Candidate 1 - November 3, 2021</strong> </p>
      <ul>
        <li> New and/or removed components:
          <ul>
            <li> argent77 contributed <strong>Create Interval Saves</strong> and <strong>Reset UnderSigil Fog of War</strong> </li>
            <li> The <strong>Make Xan a Generalist Mage [Mike1072]</strong> was generalized and made into similar components for Dynaheir, Edwin, and Xzar by Angel </li>
            <li> Added<strong> Allow Monks to Wear Helmets</strong>,<strong> Enhanced Overlays for Colorblind Players [Fouinto]</strong>, and <strong>Removable <abbr title="Non-Player Character">NPC</abbr> Items</strong> </li>
            <li> <strong>Remove Blur Effect from Equipped Items</strong> and <strong>Invisible Cloak of Mirroring</strong> have been merged into a new component, <strong>Remove Annoying Visual Effects from Equipped Items</strong>. The scope has been broadened to cover any item that contains annoying, persistent visual effects. </li>
            <li> <strong>Description Updates for Make +x/+y Weapons Consistent Component</strong> has been deprecated; item descriptions will be updated automatically by the main component if the translation is available </li>
            <li> The <strong>Exotic Items Pack</strong> has been moved permanently to <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/mods/quests/thecalling/">The Calling</a> mod. </li>
            <li> Broke out <strong>Alter Gnome Mage Kit/Multi-Class Options</strong> as a separate component instead of making a number of exceptions and assumptions in the general components. </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li> Several updates to make Tweaks Anthology integrate better with Project Infinity </li>
        <li> The static armor lists have been expanded to cover additional mods. Also components which use the static item lists&mdash;<strong>Icon Improvements</strong>, <strong>Allow Thieving and Stealth in Heavy Armor per <abbr title="Pen and Paper">PnP</abbr></strong>, <strong>Allow Arcane Spellcasting in Heavy Armor</strong>, and <strong>Allow Mages to Use Bucklers and Thieves to Use Small Shields [Angel]</strong>&mdash;should be substantially faster to install. </li>
        <li> Recoded the <strong>Limit Ability of Storekeepers to Identify Items</strong> and the <em><abbr title="Pen and Paper">PnP</abbr> restrictions</em> option for <strong>Wear Multiple Protection Items</strong> to be faster as well. </li>
        <li> Updated armor lists for the <strong> Allow Thieving and Stealth in Heavy Armor per <abbr title="Pen and Paper">PnP</abbr></strong> and <strong>Allow Arcane Spellcasting in Heavy Armor</strong> components to cover new mods </li>
        <li> Added compatibility updates for Tome and Blood with the components that adjust spellcasting tables and Anthology checking for the wrong component number in a few places </li>
        <li> Added compatibility updates between the components that update spell tables and the <abbr title="Enhanced Edition">EE</abbr> version of Region of Terror </li>
        <li> <strong>Ensure Shar-Teel Doesn&#39;t Die in the Original Challenge</strong> was not working in <abbr title="Enhanced Edition Trilogy">EET</abbr> as her joining is handled by her combat script, not her normal script. Also fixed a bug where the component didn&#39;t work on <abbr title="Original Baldur's Gate">oBG</abbr> at all. </li>
        <li> Added an updated Italian translation from ilot. </li>
        <li> The <strong>Un-Nerfed <abbr title="To-Hit Armor Class 0">THAC0</abbr> Table</strong> had been capping <abbr title="To-Hit Armor Class 0">THAC0</abbr> at 1, and will now cap it at 0 </li>
        <li> <strong>Change Korgan to Neutral Evil Alignment</strong> broke his leaving-the-party <abbr title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</abbr> dialogue as it was explicitly checking for him being CE </li>
        <li> <strong>Unique Containers [Miloch]</strong> has been recoded to assign icons and names as containers are found, rather than using a fixed list. This new approach also fixes a bug where the component would crash if it ran out of slots. Also fixed a potential conflict with the Secret of Bone Hill mod and a few other small errors. </li>
        <li> <strong>Loosen Equipment Restrictions for Cleric Multi- and Dual-Classes</strong> was still restricting many items for kitted clerics due to some redundant usability flags. The component will now check and remove these flags as appropriate. </li>
        <li> <strong>Friendly Random Drops</strong> was handing out items with zero charges, which is now fixed. Also fixed a bug where it would fail to install on an <abbr title="Original Icewind Dale">oIWD</abbr> game with <strong>Restored Random Drops</strong> (from <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/mods/quests/ub_iwd/">Unfinished Business for <abbr title="Icewind Dale">IWD</abbr></a>) installed. </li>
        <li> As the <abbr title="Enhanced Edition">EE</abbr> supports kits for multi-classes, <strong>Multi-Class Grandmastery</strong> and <strong>Druids Use <abbr title="3rd Edition">3e</abbr> Alignment Restrictions</strong> now account for them </li>
        <li> The non-silly version of <strong>Faster Chapter One and Two Cutscenes and Dreams</strong> could fail to match and replace all of the scripting it was supposed to </li>
        <li> <strong>Make Khalid a Fighter-Mage [Domi]</strong> was not covering his <abbr title="Siege of Dragonspear">SoD</abbr> incarnation, and its unnecessarily complex spawning script could cause multiple Khalids to appear if you didn&#39;t recruit him the first you met at the <abbr title="Friendly Arm Inn">FAI</abbr> </li>
        <li> <strong>No Traps or Locks [Weimer]</strong> was checking the wrong fields for keys, causing it to behave erratically. </li>
        <li> <strong>Move Boo Into Minsc&#39;s Pack</strong> is now available on <abbr title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</abbr> games </li>
        <li> Courtesy of Jazira, with proofreading from Gwendolyne and Elisabeth, the French translation has been updated. Jazira also reviewed the English translation, and submitted several grammar and spelling fixes there as well. </li>
        <li> Fixed a bug where <strong>Increase Party Movement Speed and/or Casting Speed Outside of Combat [argent77]</strong> could add duplicate scripting to the main game script. This component now covers familiars and similar mod companions. </li>
        <li> Fixed a bug where <strong>Enforce <abbr title="Pen and Paper">PnP</abbr> Proficiency Rules on Dual-Classed Characters [subtledoctor]</strong> was borking kit ability tables </li>
        <li> <strong>Increase Party Movement Speed and/or Casting Speed Outside of Combat [argent77] </strong>now covers casting speed and has been renamed to reflect this. It will now cover familiars and other mod companions like Grey the Dog </li>
        <li> <strong>Change Cloakwood Mine Chapter End Change Trigger to Non-<abbr title="Tales of the Sword Coast">TotSC</abbr> Behavior [plainab]</strong> was using the wrong values on <abbr title="Enhanced Edition Trilogy">EET</abbr> and therefore not properly removing journal entries </li>
        <li> <strong>Lightning Bolts Don&#39;t Bounce [Angel]</strong> needed an update to work on the 2.6 series of <abbr title="Enhanced Edition">EE</abbr> games due to some projectile format changes </li>
        <li> <strong><abbr title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</abbr> Cannot Pass Doors</strong> no longer changes the door in the Spellhold dream sequence, as an <abbr title="Non-Player Character">NPC</abbr> passing this door is required for the &#39;good&#39; outcome of the dream </li>
        <li> All <strong>Alter Weapon Proficiency System</strong> options will now preserve racial bonuses with weapons on <abbr title="Enhanced Edition">EE</abbr> games </li>
        <li> <strong>Remove Racial Restrictions for Kits</strong> will now allow for non-human monks. Since non-humans do not have specific monk animations, they will re-use their cleric animations for monks. As halflings lacked a mage animation they would default to fighter animations when choosing a mage class; these now also use cleric animations. Wild mages and barbarians are also made available. </li>
        <li> <strong>Remove Racial Restrictions for Single-Classes</strong> now includes a configuration-level option (see the cdtweaks.txt file) that will adjust the half-orc intelligence penalty from -2 to -1, to allow for easier dual-classing to mages (assuming an appropriate variant of <strong>Alter Dual-Class Restrictions</strong> is installed) </li>
        <li> Fixed a bug with <strong><abbr title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</abbr>-Style <abbr title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</abbr></strong> where <abbr title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</abbr> could potentially show up with -1 <abbr title="Experience Points">XP</abbr> </li>
        <li> <strong>Move <abbr title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</abbr> to Convenient Locations</strong> now also tries to catch any area-level variables in their scripting when they&#39;re moved, hopefully resolving an odd bug or two with other mods </li>
        <li> <strong>Send BioWare <abbr title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</abbr> to an Inn [DavidW/Zed Nocear]</strong> and <strong>Allow <abbr title="Non-Player Character">NPC</abbr> Pairs to Separate</strong> were having some issues on <abbr title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</abbr> games, which should be fixed. </li>
        <li> <strong>Send BioWare <abbr title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</abbr> to an Inn [DavidW/Zed Nocear]</strong> now accounts for the Endless <abbr title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</abbr> mod, which lets you hang around after the end of the campaign. It also added some custom variables to allow for other mods to restrict the inn options for story-related purposes. </li>
        <li> Updated the Russian translation so that it would work on both the originals and <abbr title="Enhanced Editions">EEs</abbr> (thanks Andrey Balabokhin) </li>
        <li> On <abbr title="Original Baldur's Gate">oBG</abbr>, <strong>Two-Handed Bastard Swords</strong> was also allowing scimitars and long swords to be wielded two-handed </li>
        <li> <strong>Allow Yeslick to Use Axes</strong> now properly accounts for <strong>Multi-Class Grandmastery</strong>, if installed </li>
        <li> If <strong>Allow Mages to Use Bucklers and Thieves to Use Small Shields [Angel]</strong> and <strong>Weapon Styles for All</strong> are both installed, mages should be able to access the Sword and Shield weapon style. However, this only worked if <strong>Weapon Styles for All</strong> was installed second of the two; these will now work together regardless of install order </li>
        <li> The <strong>Happy Patch - Alter How Party <abbr title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</abbr> Complain About Reputation </strong>was not quite covering all of the ways Shar-Teel could leave due to reputation if the <abbr title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</abbr> <abbr title="Non-Player Character">NPC</abbr> Project was installed </li>
        <li> <strong>Alter Multi-Class Restrictions</strong> and <strong>Alter Dual-Class Restrictions</strong> now try to edit the appropriate strings in character creation to reflect the rule changes </li>
        <li> <strong>Icewind Dale Casting Graphics [Andyr]</strong> and <strong>Baldur&#39;s Gate Casting Graphics [Andyr]</strong> now include casting sounds; on <abbr title="Enhanced Edition">EE</abbr> games they&#39;ll also use the nicer blended animations </li>
        <li> <strong>Icon Improvements </strong>now has a special ground icon for drow chain, as the bright green elven chain icon really stood out in places like the Underdark. The green elven chain has also been toned down a bit. </li>
        <li> <strong>Enforce <abbr title="Pen and Paper">PnP</abbr> Proficiency Rules on Dual-Classed Characters [subtledoctor]</strong> now requires <abbr title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</abbr> due to a bug in <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr> v247 </li>
        <li> <abbr title="Enhanced Edition Trilogy">EET</abbr> uses slightly different <abbr title="Baldur's Gate">BG</abbr> resources that were being missed in a few components: <strong>Adjust Evil Joinable <abbr title="Non-Player Character">NPC</abbr> Reactions</strong> was missing Edwin; <strong><abbr title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</abbr></strong><strong> Don&#39;t Fight</strong> was missing several conflicts; <strong>Unique Containers [Miloch]</strong> missed a few bags; <strong>Consistent Stats</strong> could miss a copy of Edwin and Minsc; <strong>Make Xan a Generalist Mage [Mike1072]</strong> could miss a copy of Xan. Related, <strong>Give Coran a Legal Dexterity Score of 19</strong> also missed an <abbr title="Siege of Dragonspear">SoD</abbr> version of Coran. </li>
        <li> <strong>Add Bags of Holding</strong> would fail to install on <abbr title="Original Icewind Dale">oIWD</abbr> without the <abbr title="Trials of the Luremaster">TotLM</abbr> expansion </li>
        <li> <strong>Shapeshifter Rebalancing [Weimer]</strong> now tries to patch the kit ability table of the Shapeshifter rather than simply overwriting it </li>
        <li> Numerous typo fixes </li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li> Expanded armor lists for the <strong> Allow Stealth and Thieving Abilities in Heavy Armor per <abbr title="Pen and Paper">PnP</abbr></strong> and <strong>Allow Arcane Spellcasting in Armor</strong> components to cover new mods; also added a compatibility fix for subtledoctor&#39;s mods </li>
        <li> Updated Russian translation, courtesy of Saigon1983 </li>
        <li> Added <strong>Increase party movement speed outside combat</strong> component, courtesy of argent77 </li>
        <li> <strong>Unique Icons</strong> was assigning an <abbr title="Icewind Dale">IWD</abbr>-icon to the Full Plate +2 that was obtainable via Wish; it will now use the same appearance as the other Full Plate +2 </li>
        <li> On <abbr title="Enhanced Edition">EE</abbr> games, <strong>Use <abbr title="Baldur's Gate">BG</abbr> Walking Speeds </strong> will now directly adjust the movement speeds of animations, rather than relying on mass creature patching </li>
        <li> Due to its increased interface size, the portrait from <strong>Female Edwina</strong> would end up letterboxed on <abbr title="Enhanced Edition">EE</abbr> games. The existing portrait has been upscaled, so while it&#39;s no longer letterboxed it may be a bit blurry. </li>
        <li> The various tweaks that add abilities to create a new item&mdash;<strong>Two-Handed Bastard Swords</strong>, <strong>Two-Handed Katanas</strong>, <strong>Two-Handed Axes</strong>, and some variants of <strong>Wear Multiple Protection Items</strong>&mdash;would not recharge after resting, contrary to the mod&#39;s claims. This is fixed. </li>

      <ul>
        <li> <strong>Move <abbr title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</abbr> to Convenient Locations</strong> would fail to move Eldoth on <abbr title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</abbr> installs; Shar-Teel would get moved to the right area with wrong coordinates on non-<abbr title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</abbr> installs </li>
        <li> Deprecated <strong>Stackable ankheg shells, winter wolf pelts and wyvern heads</strong> as these items already get covered as part of the <strong>Increase Jewelry, Gem, and Miscellaneous Item Stacks</strong> (previously known as <strong>Increase Jewelry and Gem Stacks</strong>) </li>
        <li> The algorithm for <strong>No Traps or Locks</strong> has been refined a bit as it was missing some trapped containers. It will also no longer remove locks for doors or containers which require a key. </li>
        <li> <abbr title="Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition">BGEE</abbr> already has the changes from <strong>Sensible Entrance Points</strong> by default, so it will now get correctly skipped for <abbr title="Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition">BGEE</abbr> and <abbr title="Enhanced Edition Trilogy">EET</abbr> games </li>
        <li> <strong>Make party members less likely to die irreversibly</strong> requires some functionality only found in <abbr title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</abbr> and <abbr title="Enhanced Edition">EE</abbr> games, and is now restricted as such </li>
        <li> <strong><abbr title="Baldur's Gate">BG</abbr> <abbr title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</abbr> go to inns</strong> was being restricted on <abbr title="Baldur's Gate">BG</abbr> games in the Gnoll Stronghold; you can now send party members to inns from the Gnoll Stronghold as you would in <abbr title="Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition">BGEE</abbr>/Tutu/<abbr title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</abbr>/<abbr title="Enhanced Edition Trilogy">EET</abbr> </li>
        <li> <strong><abbr title="Baldur's Gate">BG</abbr> <abbr title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</abbr> go to inns</strong> was also failing for some <abbr title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</abbr> on <abbr title="Enhanced Edition Trilogy">EET</abbr> games as it was patching their <abbr title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</abbr> parting dialogues instead of their <abbr title="Baldur's Gate">BG</abbr> parting dialogues </li>
        <li> <strong>Allow Yeslick to use axes</strong> could fail on <abbr title="Baldur's Gate">BG</abbr> installs as it tried to patch a <abbr title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</abbr> file without checking </li>
        <li> Fixed bug where some of the imported <abbr title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</abbr> components (such as <strong><abbr title="Baldur's Gate">BG</abbr> <abbr title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</abbr> go to inns</strong>) would fail due to a missing directory </li>
        <li> The use of the variable library for <abbr title="Baldur's Gate">BG</abbr>/<abbr title="Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition">BGEE</abbr>/Tutu/<abbr title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</abbr>/<abbr title="Enhanced Edition Trilogy">EET</abbr> has been centralized. </li>
        <li> Updated Italian translation </li>
        <li> Fixed bug with <strong>Alter Weapon Proficiency System</strong>, specifically, the <abbr title="Baldur's Gate">BG</abbr> variants, where axes could end up with descriptions that listed the proficiency type for the item as &quot;new_weap&quot; or a wrong proficiency. The error was purely cosmetic and did not affect the axe&#39;s actual proficiency. </li>

      <ul>
        <li> Updated Chinese translation again; thanks angel_c4! </li>
        <li> Fixed bug where <strong>Unique Containers (Miloch)</strong> was not being applied to Potion Bags in <abbr title="Icewind Dale">IWD</abbr>/<abbr title="Icewind Dale: Enhanced Edition">IWDEE</abbr>/<abbr title="Icewind Dale">IWD</abbr>-in-<abbr title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</abbr> games due to a typo </li>
        <li> Tried to make the text replacements for all of the <strong>Alter Weapon Proficiency System</strong> variants a little more robust when it comes to updating weapon proficiency text in item descriptions </li>
        <li> The components <strong>Move Boo out of quick access and into Minsc&#39;s pack</strong> and <strong>Move <abbr title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</abbr> to Convenient Locations: Move Alora to Gullykin</strong> were presenting the wrong component name in the installer </li>
        <li> The original Viconia dialogue file in <abbr title="Baldur's Gate">BG</abbr> had a syntax error, which would prompt the <strong>Move <abbr title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</abbr> to Convenient Locations: Move Viconia to South Beregost Road</strong> component to display a harmless warning when installed; this component now fixes the error when installed </li>
        <li> The description for the <strong>Change Item Restrictions for Multi- and Dual-class Druids</strong> component has been clarified </li>
        <li> <strong>Allow <abbr title="Non-Player Character">NPC</abbr> pairs to separate</strong> now works for <abbr title="Baldur's Gate">BG</abbr> </li>

        <li> Potion bags were not getting unique icons; thanks agris for the fix </li>
        <li> The Anthology has now consolidated components from <abbr title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</abbr> and BG1NPC:

        <li> Another run has been made to get all options of <strong>Adjust Cromwell&#39;s Forging Time</strong> to work for all platforms. </li>
        <li> The level 2/1 and 4/3 versions of Khalid in<strong> Make Khalid a Fighter-Mage (Domi)</strong> have been bumped slightly to bring his hit points in line with the other versions </li>
        <li> <strong>Disable Non-Hostile Rest Spawns</strong> and <strong>Alter Hostile Rest Spawns</strong> will no longer fail on areas that lack rest spawn info. </li>

        <li> <strong>Reputation Resets at Beginning of <abbr title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</abbr></strong> is no longer an option for <abbr title="Enhanced Edition Trilogy">EET</abbr> games, as this is already the default for <abbr title="Enhanced Edition Trilogy">EET</abbr> </li>

        <li> <strong>Allow Cromwell to Upgrade Watcher&#39;s Keep Items</strong> now accounts for the formula changes introduced by Item Revisions </li>
        <li> The greater werewolf form in <strong>Shapeshifter Rebalancing</strong> now receives the promised base <abbr title="To-Hit Armor Class 0">THAC0</abbr> of 6 </li>
        <li> Various components, especially in the rules section, were being made available for <abbr title="Icewind Dale II">IWD2</abbr> games even though they did not apply </li>

        <li> Fixed bug with <strong>Exotic Items</strong> where it could fail to install on some Tutu games </li>
        <li> Externalized strings for the <strong>Universal Clubs</strong> component to make it easier for translators </li>
        <li> <strong>Increase Jewelry and Gem Stacks</strong> or <strong>Increase Scroll Stacking</strong> components would try to adjust dialogues and scripts to only take one item in original <abbr title="Baldur's Gate">BG</abbr>/<abbr title="Tales of the Sword Coast">TotSC</abbr>, but the functionality is not available in these games. </li>
        <li> Fixed bug with <strong>Commoners Use Drab Colors</strong> where it could sometimes fail to install on original <abbr title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</abbr> </li>
        <li> The options in <strong>Adjust Cromwell&#39;s Forging Time</strong> have been re-ordered to work around a <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr> quirk (this component could get skipped when it should be available) </li>
        <li> <strong>Description Updates for Make +x/+y Weapons Consistent Component</strong> was being skipped for Chinese players, even though it was available </li>
        <li> <strong>Remove Racial Restrictions for Single Classes</strong> was not actually altering the dwarven charisma cap; now they really can be paladins </li>

        <li> Anthology now supports translated readmes, should anyone wish to try their hand </li>

      <ul>
        <li> <strong>Bottomless Bags of Holding</strong> now works for <abbr title="Planescape: Torment: Enhanced Edition">PsTEE</abbr> </li>
        <li> The <strong>Exotic Item Pack</strong> could fail to install on <abbr title="Enhanced Edition Trilogy">EET</abbr>, <abbr title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</abbr>, or <abbr title="Baldur's Gate">BG</abbr> due to typos and a missing library. Strings for the items could also potentially be incorrect. </li>
        <li> <strong>Increase Ammo Stack Size</strong> had a typo in the library that would prevent installation </li>
        <li> <strong>Disable Non-Hostile Rest Spawns</strong> and <strong>Alter Hostile Rest Spawns</strong> were also enabling <strong>Rest Anywhere</strong> </li>

        <li> Updated Chinese translation thanks to c4_angel </li>
        <li> Updated variable names for the <strong>Romance Cheats</strong> component </li>
        <li> <strong>Level-Locked Spell Scrolls</strong> is no longer an option for <abbr title="Icewind Dale">IWD</abbr>/<abbr title="Baldur's Gate">BG</abbr> games, as these engines ignore minimum level requirements in item files </li>
        <li> <strong>Lightning Bolts Don&#39;t Bounce</strong> will now protect the caster from being hit by his/her own lightning bolt for games which still use a multi-target projectile (everything but <abbr title="Icewind Dale">IWD</abbr>/<abbr title="Baldur's Gate">BG</abbr>, which use a single-target projectile that can&#39;t hurt the caster) </li>
        <li> <strong>Alter Druid Spell and Level Progression Tables</strong>, specifically the option to have druids use the cleric <abbr title="Experience Points">XP</abbr> progression table, is now available for <abbr title="Icewind Dale">IWD</abbr>/<abbr title="Baldur's Gate">BG</abbr> games </li>
        <li> The option to tighten restrictions via <strong>Change Item Restrictions for Multi- and Dual-class Druids</strong> is now more selective about tightening restrictions; among other things this fixes a bug where Jaheira got locked out of her Harper Pin </li>

        <li> Tweaks Anthology will no longer install on games that require Modmerge and instead point users to Modmerge and how to install it </li>
        <li> The mod will better detect <abbr title="Planescape: Torment: Enhanced Edition">PsTEE</abbr> games and offer components appropriately. This better detection also addresses some other bugs, such as the <strong>Rest Anywhere</strong> component not working on <abbr title="Planescape: Torment: Enhanced Edition">PsTEE</abbr>. </li>
        <li> The <strong>Exotic Item Pack</strong> was rewritten to address some minor bugs and streamline the code; the Katana +2 had its effect percentages corrected </li>
        <li> <strong>Wear Multiple Protection Items</strong> has a new option, <em>Allow Armor Plus One Protection Item</em> </li>
        <li> <strong>Loosen Item Restrictions for Multi- and Dual-class Druids</strong> is now <strong>Change Item Restrictions for Multi- and Dual-class Druids</strong>, as you now have options to loosen or tighten these restrictions. </li>
        <li> <strong>Allow Cromwell to Upgrade Watcher&#39;s Keep Items</strong> was streamlined a bit, mainly to make the new Cromwell component easier to write </li>
        <li> All <strong>Alter Weapon Proficiency System</strong> options save <em>Rebalanced Proficiencies</em> could potentially rob joinable <abbr title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</abbr> of overall pips since various proficiencies could get combined. These &quot;duplicate proficiency&quot; points are now re-assigned so that joinable <abbr title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</abbr> retain their correct total of weapon pips. </li>
        <li> <strong>Maximum <abbr title="Hit Points">HP</abbr> Creatures</strong> was not properly accounting for dual-class characters, potentially shorting their maximum HPs </li>

      <ul>
        <li> A new configuration file, cdtweaks.txt, is now available in the mod&#39;s folder. Players can use this file to set inputs for the <strong>Romance Cheats</strong> and <strong>Minimum Stats Cheat</strong> components prior to installation. Doing so will allow the mod to be installed unattended, e.g. as part of a Big World Setup install. If the configuration file is not utilized, or indicates no changes, the player will be prompted during installation of these components, just like before. </li>
        <li> Added <strong>Remove Blur Effect from Equipped Items</strong> and <strong>Exceptional Strength Weight Limit Changes </strong> components </li>
        <li> <strong>Reveal City Maps</strong> is not actually the default for <abbr title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</abbr>, so this component is now available </li>
        <li> Fixed a bug with <strong>Do Not Reveal City Maps</strong> where it could stuff other on-load actions in area scripts </li>
        <li> <strong>Gems and Potions Require Identification</strong> now has the option to just affect gems, just affect potions, or both </li>
        <li> Fixed two bugs with the <strong>Change Experience Point Cap</strong> &gt; <em>Remove Completely</em> option. It was not extending the shaman spell tables, causing shamans to lose spellcasting ability after level 40. In addition, players on <abbr title="Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition">BGEE</abbr>/<abbr title="Siege of Dragonspear">SoD</abbr> games would get trapped at the level-up screen on high levels, since the game had <abbr title="High-Level Ability">HLA</abbr> tables defined but no <abbr title="High-Level Abilities">HLAs</abbr> to select. </li>
        <li> With the <abbr title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</abbr> <abbr title="Non-Player Character">NPC</abbr> Project installed, Shar-Teel could still leave due to high reputation with the <strong>Happy Patch </strong>installed. This is no longer the case. </li>
        <li> <strong>No Traps or Locks</strong> had a small bug where it could overwrite flags in the area file. It also tries to be a bit more precise on which traps and locks to remove. </li>
        <li> Fixed a bug with the <em>Multiple Romances </em>option of <strong>Romance Cheats</strong> where the original BioWare romances could possibly stall after meeting the Gorion-wraith in Throne of Bhaal. </li>
        <li> Closed an exploit with <strong>Stores Purchase All Item Types</strong> where special stores&mdash;such as Officer Vai in Beregost&mdash;could be used for money generation due to their special buy/sell markups. </li>
        <li> Fixed bug with <strong>Taerom Makes Additional Ankheg Armors</strong> where he was not checking for the correct item in Tutu games to reset his armor timer </li>
        <li> <strong>Improved Fate Spirit Summoning</strong> is no longer available for install on <abbr title="Enhanced Edition Trilogy">EET</abbr> games, as <abbr title="Enhanced Edition Trilogy">EET</abbr> includes similar functionality by default </li>
        <li> The armor lookup table used by <strong>Allow Stealth and Thieving Abilities in Heavy Armor per <abbr title="Pen and Paper">PnP</abbr></strong>, <strong>Allow Arcane Spellcasting in Armor</strong>, and <strong>Icon Improvements</strong> has been expanded with new items, notably <abbr title="Enhanced Edition Trilogy">EET</abbr>. </li>
        <li> The werewolf paws in <strong>Shapeshifter Rebalancing</strong> are now flagged as two-handed items to prevent their use in the offhand or with a shield. </li>
        <li> <strong>Alter Weapon Proficiency System</strong> &gt; <em>Rebalanced Weapon Proficiencies</em> should now be more reliable updating weapon proficiency names in items, specifically ninja-to, in <abbr title="Enhanced Edition">EE</abbr> games. </li>
        <li> Fixed bug with <strong>Unique Containers</strong> trying to patch a mod item that was not a bag. </li>
        <li> If the <strong>Increase Jewelry and Gem Stacks</strong> or <strong>Increase Scroll Stacking</strong> components make an item stackable where it was not, actions in scripts and dialogues could potentially take an entire stack of these items where previously they only took one item. The component will now adjust these actions to only take one item. </li>
      </ul>
      <p> <a id="history_beta5" name="history_beta5"></a><strong>Version Beta 5 - July 27, 2016</strong> </p>
      <ul>
        <li> <strong>Wear Multiple Protection Items</strong> will no longer fail when patching items that have effects listed before abilities (thanks Nythrun, Ardanis, and Mike1072) </li>
        <li> Improved <abbr title="Enhanced Edition Trilogy">EET</abbr> compatibility (thanks K4thos) </li>
      </ul>
      <p> <a id="history_beta4" name="history_beta4"></a><strong>Version Beta 4 - May 1, 2016</strong> </p>
      <ul>
        <li> <strong>Make Magic Shields Glow</strong> had two bugs preventing its installation; it would halt on games without an extended color palette (e.g. non-<abbr title="Enhanced Edition">EE</abbr> games or without 1pp) and would halt on shields without any colors set, such as <abbr title="Icewind Dale">IWD</abbr>&#39;s Lyre of Progression </li>
        <li> <strong>Unique Containers</strong> was supposed to be available for <abbr title="Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition">BGEE</abbr>, but was omitted from the allowed platforms list for the component </li>
        <li> The werewolf paws in <strong>Shapeshifter Rebalancing</strong> now get named explicitly </li>
        <li> <strong>Move <abbr title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</abbr> from Baldur&#39;s Gate</strong> will now be skipped if the <abbr title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</abbr> version of same is installed. The component will also skip <abbr title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</abbr> already moved by similar components in the <abbr title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</abbr> <abbr title="Non-Player Character">NPC</abbr> Project, or skip the component altogether if all three have been moved already. </li>
        <li> <strong>Change Experience Point Cap</strong> should now work on Siege of Dragonspear </li>
        <li> Included workarounds for incomplete 25stweap.2da in Siege of Dragonspear and <abbr title="Icewind Dale: Enhanced Edition">IWDEE</abbr> for the various components that touch kits (<strong>Enforce <abbr title="Pen and Paper">PnP</abbr> Proficiency Rules on Dual-Classed Characters</strong> and <strong>Expanded Dual-Class Options</strong>), though the next patches should take care of this. In general, the component should be more forgiving for incomplete files. </li>
        <li> <strong>Remove Racial Restrictions for Single Classes</strong> and <strong>Remove Racial Restrictions for Kits</strong> will no longer allow non-human monks. Other races do not have monk animations so the engine tends to crash during character generation. Support for shamans has been added to both. </li>
        <li> If <strong>Druids Use <abbr title="3rd Edition">3e</abbr> Alignment Restrictions</strong> was installed after <strong>Shapeshifter Rebalancing</strong>, which is the likely install order, non-true neutral shapeshifter druids would not be able to use their symbolic paws. </li>
        <li> On a suggestion from Sam., the component <strong>Stores Purchase All Item Types</strong> has been added. </li>
        <li> <strong>Minimum Stats Cheat</strong> now lets you specify minimums for the six attributes individually. </li>
        <li> <strong>Friendly Random Drops</strong> needed a few more fixes
          <ul>
            <li> The &#39;Token Genie&#39; was undead, meaning a cleric could turn or even chunk him. </li>
            <li> Items with charges should now be handled in a more robust fashion </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li> The library for fixing kit.ids as part of should now be up to date for <strong>Expanded Dual-Class Options</strong> </li>
        <li> The <abbr title="Baldur's Gate">BG</abbr> and <abbr title="Icewind Dale">IWD</abbr> variants of <strong>Alter Weapon Proficiency System</strong> should now account for racial bonuses in the <abbr title="Enhanced Edition">EE</abbr> games </li>
        <li> <strong>Sensible Entrance Points</strong> only modifies the Beregost entrance point for <abbr title="Baldur's Gate">BG</abbr> content on <abbr title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</abbr> games, as <abbr title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</abbr> already defines good entrances for the other areas. </li>
        <li> Updated Italian translation, thanks improb@bile! </li>
      </ul>
      <p> <a id="history_beta3" name="history_beta3"></a><strong>Version Beta 3 - March 20, 2016</strong> </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Miloch&#39;s <strong>Unique Containers</strong> mod has been added to Anthology as a cosmetic component, including all of its original options and translations. If <strong>Add Bags of Holding</strong> is installed after it, the new bags will use the unique icons. </li>
        <li> Added <strong>Use Character Colors Instead of Item Colors</strong> component </li>
        <li> Added components <strong>Everyone Gets Bonus <abbr title="Attacks Per Round">APR</abbr> from Specialization (subtledoctor)</strong> and <strong>Enforce <abbr title="Pen and Paper">PnP</abbr> Proficiency Rules on Dual-Classed Characters (subtledoctor)</strong> courtesy of subtledoctor </li>
        <li> <strong>Make Magic Shields Glow</strong> will now try to read in an appropriate glow color from the palette bitmap instead of a (limited) lookup table </li>
        <li> Fixed a bug with <strong>Higher <abbr title="Hit Points">HP</abbr> on Level Up</strong> &gt; <em><abbr title="Neverwinter Nights">NWN</abbr>-Style</em>; withdrew the <em>Low Variance Rolls</em> option due to the same bug </li>
        <li> Fixed a math error in <strong>Change Experience Point Cap</strong> &gt; <em>Remove Completely</em> that caused bards and thieves to need an extra 100,000 <abbr title="Experience Points">XP</abbr> to advance from level 39 to 40 </li>
        <li> Fixed a bug with <strong>Send BioWare <abbr title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</abbr> to an Inn</strong> where it wouldn&#39;t install on original Baldur&#39;s Gate due to bad tra references (thanks Angel) </li>
        <li> <strong>Friendly Random Drops</strong> was failing to account for two random drops in <abbr title="Icewind Dale: Enhanced Edition">IWDEE</abbr> that are different compared to <abbr title="Icewind Dale">IWD</abbr>+<abbr title="Unfinished Business">UB</abbr>; the fix in beta 2 caused it to not install on original <abbr title="Icewind Dale">IWD</abbr>, which is in turn fixed (thanks to Angel again) </li>
        <li> The <strong>Change Avatar When Wearing Robes or Armor (Galactygon)</strong> component is being withdrawn, as One Pixel Productions has a superior solution </li>
      </ul>
      <p> <a id="history_beta2" name="history_beta2"></a><strong>Version Beta 2 - March 8, 2016</strong> </p>

        <li> <strong>Unique Icons</strong> was expanded to <abbr title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</abbr> games; also fixed a bug where it was not updating helmet animations </li>
        <li> After discussion, <strong>Rest Anywhere</strong> was expanded into multiple components. The main component continues to work as the original, and <strong>Disable Non-Hostile Rest Spawns</strong> and <strong>Alter Hostile Rest Spawns</strong> have been added to give players a finer grain of control. </li>
        <li> <strong>Friendly Random Drops</strong> could pull from the wrong table in <abbr title="Icewind Dale: Enhanced Edition">IWDEE</abbr>. </li>
        <li> Fixed a bug with <strong>Friendly Random Drops</strong> &gt; <em>Choose Your Drop</em> where it was not accounting for Orrick&#39;s reward after you bring him the Mythal book. Also fixed the bug that would cause the Kuldahar merchant to leave after the orog attack, for real this time. </li>
        <li> All BAMs in the mod converted to uncompressed for better cross-platform goodness. </li>
        <li> Fixed a couple of bugs where <strong>Faster Chapter 1&amp;2 Cut-Scenes &amp; Dreams</strong> was not quite matching and replacing everything it should and Gaelan&#39;s dialogue lacked the shortcuts it was supposed to have </li>
        <li> <strong>Faster Chapter 1&amp;2 Cut-Scenes &amp; Dreams</strong> will skip adjusting the Irenicus-Cowled Wizard cutscene in the Promenade if the player has installed <strong>Extended Waukeen&#39;s Promenade Cutscene</strong> from Almateria&#39;s Restoration Project. Other cutscenes and dreams are still affected in this case. </li>
        <li> Fixed bug with <strong>Increase Potion Stacking</strong> where it handled items with multiple charges incorrectly; thanks argent77! </li>
        <li> OS X version now up to date with <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr> v239, as the Windows version; thanks argent77 again! </li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li> New components:
          <ul>
            <li> New - <strong>Baldur&#39;s Gate Casting Graphics, Max <abbr title="Hit Points">HP</abbr> at Level One</strong>, <strong>Recoverable ammunition (argent77)</strong>, <strong>Recoverable throwing weapons (argent77)</strong> </li>
            <li> From <abbr title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</abbr> Tweaks - <strong>Make Magic Shields Glow (plainab/grogerson)</strong>, <strong>Send BioWare <abbr title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</abbr> to an Inn (DavidW/Zed Nocear), Portable Containers (Zed Nocear)</strong>, <strong>Friendly Arm Inn Hidden Container Restoration (plainab)</strong>, <strong>Move <abbr title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</abbr> from Baldur&#39;s Gate</strong>, <strong>Bardic Reputation Adjustment, Change Cloakwood Mine Chapter End Change Trigger to Non-<abbr title="Tales of the Sword Coast">TotSC</abbr> Behavior, Paladins Use <abbr title="Icewind Dale">IWD</abbr>-<abbr title="Heart of Winter">HoW</abbr> Spell Progression Tables (grogerson), Rangers Use <abbr title="Icewind Dale">IWD</abbr>-<abbr title="Heart of Winter">HoW</abbr> Spell Progression Tables (grogerson), Druids Use <abbr title="3rd Edition">3e</abbr> Alignment Restrictions, Loosen Item Restrictions for Multi- and Dual-class Clerics, Loosen Item Restrictions for Multi- and Dual-class Druids</strong>, <strong>Taerom Makes Additional Ankheg Armors (Icendoan/grogerson)</strong>, <strong>Give Coran A Legal Dexterity Score of 19</strong>, and <strong>Make Xan a Generalist Mage (Mike1072)</strong> </li>

            <li> From <abbr title="Icewind Dale">IWD</abbr> Tweaks - <strong>Friendly Random Drops</strong>, <strong>Restore <abbr title="Icewind Dale">IWD</abbr> Loading Screens (icelus)</strong>, and <strong>Unique Icons</strong> </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li> Fixed a bug with <strong>Gradual Drow Item Disintegration</strong>; items should have a chance to break upon use </li>
        <li> Improved <strong>Improved Multi-Player Kick-out Dialogues</strong> further with input from <abbr title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</abbr> Tweaks; <abbr title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</abbr> in <abbr title="Baldur's Gate">BG</abbr> now have more places to go when kicked out </li>

In the <em>No Restrictions</em> variant, it would fail to account for the shifted clerical stronghold alignments in <abbr title="Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition">BG2EE</abbr>.

Also fixed a bug where the druid restriction was still in place, preventing the messenger who would summon you back to the Grove. Also fixed a bug where both variants could bypass the bard stronghold <abbr title="Experience Points">XP</abbr> reward from Raelis for rescuing the troupe from the Planar Prison. </li>

        <li> kit.ids is now properly patched as part of <strong>Expanded Dual-Class Options</strong> </li>
        <li> Fixed a fairly large and glaring oversight with <strong>Wear Multiple Protection Items</strong> &gt; <em><abbr title="Pen and Paper">PnP</abbr> Restrictions</em> where the items with <abbr title="Armor Class">AC</abbr> bonuses could still be worn together </li>
        <li> <strong>Alter Weapon Proficiency System</strong> underwent a significant revamp.

        <li> <em>True Grandmastery</em> is now one option in <strong>Change Grandmastery Bonuses</strong> instead of a standalone component, as a <abbr title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</abbr> option has been added. </li>

        <li> Fixed a bug when adding <strong>Friendly Random Drops</strong> &gt; <em>Wandering Merchant </em>that would cause the Kuldahar merchant to leave after the orog attack </li>
        <li> Added more <abbr title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</abbr> to the <strong>Improved Fate Spirit Summoning</strong> component </li>
        <li> <strong><abbr title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</abbr>-Style <abbr title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</abbr></strong> should now have a more robust method of finding joinable <abbr title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</abbr> and their creature files </li>
        <li> <strong>Consistent Stats: Viconia</strong> should now better adjust her spellbook to account for the gain or loss of bonus spells due to the change in wisdom </li>
        <li> Fixed similar issues with <strong>Make Khalid a Fighter-Mage (Domi)</strong> and <strong>Make Montaron an Assassin (Andyr)</strong>; now it checks for walking speeds on non-Tutu games, better adjusts proficiencies for the alternative schemes, and now work if installed after <strong><abbr title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</abbr>-Style <abbr title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</abbr></strong> </li>
        <li> <strong>Faster Chapter 1&amp;2 Cut-Scenes &amp; Dreams (Karzak, Blucher, aVENGER, Weimer) </strong> no longer overwrites scripts, which was causing a compatibility issue with <abbr title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</abbr> </li>

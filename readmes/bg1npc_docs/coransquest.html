  <p> Coran's Quest walkthrough/summary</p>

<p> Enter the Firewine Bridge Area with Coran in your group. After a while a banter between Coran and the PC begins about a lovely Lady. You can find this lovely Lady near the entrance to the Firewine Ruins. Her name is Amelia.</p>

<p> If you help Amelia, <a class="spoiler" id="spoiler_1" name="spoiler_1" href="#spoiler_1">she gives Coran Withered Roses. Go to the Temple near Beregost and speak with Rashel. Rashel restores the flowers and Coran has now Red Roses. Let Rashel bless Coran or not. This makes no difference. Go back to the Firewine Bridge and enter the Firewine Ruins. Find Natan near the exit and he will speak to you automatically. He will give you the Multicolored Powder and leave the ruins.</a> </p>

<p> You have now three choices:</p>

<p> <a class="spoiler" id="spoiler_2" name="spoiler_2" href="#spoiler_2">1. Speak with Amelia and give her the powder. She will give you a gift and disappear. Natan and Coran will go with her. </a> </p>
<p> <a class="spoiler" id="spoiler_3" name="spoiler_3" href="#spoiler_3">2. Speak with Amelia and give her the powder only if she releases her captives. Amelia will give you a gift and disappear. Speak with Natan and if you chose the right answers he gives you potions. Then he disappears. </a></p>
<p> <a class="spoiler" id="spoiler_4" name="spoiler_4" href="#spoiler_4">3. Speak with Amelia and say that she must die. Amelia attacks you. Natan and Coran attack you, too. After you have killed Amelia, Natan and Coran turn back to normal. After you take the ring from Amelia's corpse, Natan speaks to you automatically. If you chose the right answers, he will give you potions. </a></p>


<p> If you do not help Amelia, <a class="spoiler" id="spoiler_8" name="spoiler_8" href="#spoiler_8"> enter the Firewine Ruins. You can find Natan near the exit. He will speak to you automatically. </a> </p>

<p> You have now three choices:</p>

<p> <a class="spoiler" id="spoiler_5" name="spoiler_5" href="#spoiler_5">1. Help Natan and leave the Firewine Ruins. Speak with Amelia again and kill her. Take the ring from her corpse and speak with Natan again. He will take the ring from you. If you chose the right answers, he will give you potions. </a></p>
<p> <a class="spoiler" id="spoiler_6" name="spoiler_6" href="#spoiler_6">2. Kill Natan and take the Multicolored Powder from his corpse. Go back to Amelia and speak with her. Give her the powder. She gives you a gift and disappears. Or don't give her the powder and kill her.</a></p>
<p> <a class="spoiler" id="spoiler_7" name="spoiler_7" href="#spoiler_7">3. Speak with Amelia again and change your opinion. Go back to Natan and kill him. You can kill him only if you use the "Sword-Symbol-Button", force-attacking him. Kill Natan and take the Multicolored Powder from his corpse. Go back to Amelia and speak with her. Give her the powder. She will give you a gift and disappear. Or don't give her the powder and kill her.</a> </p>

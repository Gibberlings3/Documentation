<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>Kagain's Quest starts from two points, but involves Bandits, Murder, and
    Mayhem. It is realtively short, but has an added payoff when you get to Baldur's
    Gate.&nbsp; It can be both initiated and completed with or without Kagain,
    thoug obviously there is more dialogue and it makes more of a story if Kagain
  is in the party at least until the basic portion of the quest is completed.</p>
</div>
<h2>Walkthrough</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p><strong>SPOILER ALERT:</strong> To read sections that contain spoiler information,
select/highlight the invisible text or hover your mouse over it.</p>
  <p>
  The starting point is either at Kagain's shop in area FW3353 (part of&nbsp; <a
  href="http://www.dudleyville.com/bg1/ar3300.htm">http://www.dudleyville.com/bg1/ar3300.htm</a> )
  or in the wilderness to the east of the road in the Coast Way&nbsp; <a
  href="http://www.dudleyville.com/bg1/ar2800.htm">http://www.dudleyville.com/bg1/ar2800.htm</a>&nbsp; . </p>
    If the Player meets Kagain and Kagain joins the party&nbsp; first, Initial
  state 0 A_T_A SetGlobal KagainCaravan=10, if he joins the party Set KagainCaravan=10
  X#KagainCaravan=1,&nbsp; then go find some caravans in trouble to your north.
      <p>The party with Kagain <a class="spoiler" id="spoiler_1" name="spoiler_1" href="#spoiler_1">enters&nbsp; FW2800, and Kagain chimes
            in about checking out the East route. You run into bandits that have
            just killed everyone in Kagain's caravan. He is NOT amused. After
            appropriate... discussion, Kagain wipes his axe and sees about joining.
            You find a fibula (fancy word for a broach that identifies household
            members of nobility), and you can kick Kagain out or party on with
            him. </a></p>
      <p>script actions are: <a class="spoiler" id="spoiler_2" name="spoiler_2" href="#spoiler_2"> _KAGAIN.BCS If 1 SDNS, Set X#KagainCaravan,GLOBAL,2
            dialogue to 3<br />
    Player1 meets Bandit (static area spawn), X#TalkedEddard=0 (forced fight,
    pick up Silvershield's pin) regardless of Kagain's status, then X#KagainCaravan=3
    X#TalkedEddard=1<br />
    If Kagain is InParty, Eddard Dead, CC(0), !S(E), X#KagainCaravan=3, X#TalkedEddard=1,
    then Set X#TalkedEddard=2 SDNS<br />
    If Kagain joins, set X#KagainCaravan=4, area script sets KACASH, final dialogue
    gives gold based on global and terminates with X#KagainCaravan=5<br />
    Responding to giving party money, X#KagainCaravan=5<br />
    If he is turned down, he leaves as originally scripted (EscapeArea())<br />
    Party exits quest either way with item to return to SS Estate, X#KagainCaravan=5,
    X#TalkedEddard=2</a></p>
      <p>
      If Player1 and the party explore the Coast Way fully before meeting Kagain, <a class="spoiler" id="spoiler_3" name="spoiler_3" href="#spoiler_3">they
      may run into the bandits first. They are bandits. Kill them.&nbsp; You
      can skip meeting Kagain completely, and continue on until you are in Baldur's
      Gate, or you can go pick up Kagain now. In his shop, you have some new
      responses, talking about the caravan you saw. It is dependent on globals,
      not the fibula you picked up from Eddard's body, but you want to go back
      and get that item if you want to trigger the Baldur's Gate interaction
      -- that one works off of the party having the item.&nbsp; Have Kagain join,
      or not -- his primary part of the quest was resolved even before he joined
      up.</a></p>

      <p>Either way, the Party exits the major portion of the quest&nbsp; <a class="spoiler" id="spoiler_9" name="spoiler_9" href="#spoiler_9">with the fibula to&nbsp; return
            to the Silvershields Estate in Baldurs Gate; Globals set at&nbsp; X#KagainCaravan=5,
            X#TalkedEddard=2.</a></p>
       When you get to the Silvershield's Estate in Baldur's
        Gate, Kagain really has no business with any of it (he doesn't say a
        line). <a class="spoiler" id="spoiler_10" name="spoiler_10" href="#spoiler_10">The most dialogue
        is if you have Skie and Eldoth in the party before talking to Lady Silvershield.
        It is definitely worth trying out this interaction once. If the party
        has the fibula, the guard will have a new option to send the party directly
        to Lady Silvershield upstairs. If you have come to rescue Skie and have
        Eldoth in the party, get her and then talk to step-mommy-dearest. If
        you don't have Eldoth and would prefer not to slaughter the Silvershield
        Household, just go upstairs to Lady Silvershield and talk to her, then
        leave. </a>
          <p>That should take care of the quest!</p>

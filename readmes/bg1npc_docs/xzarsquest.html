  <p><strong>Xzar´s Quest</strong></p>
  <p>Xzar's Quest begins in the area in which you can do the Bioware-Quest with
    the Dryad of the Cloudpeaks.</p>
  <p>Note: Xzar´s Quest does not start if you complete the Quest with the Dryad
    of the Cloudpeaks without Xzar in your group.</p>
  <p>If you help the Dryad of the Cloudpeaks, the Quest starts.</p>
  <p><a class="spoiler" id="spoiler_1" name="spoiler_1" href="#spoiler_1">You
      must kill “Caldo” and “Krumm”. If you not kill “Caldo” and “Krumm” Xzar´s
      Quest does not start. After you have killed the both, talk with the Dryad
      of the Cloudpeaks. </a> </p>
  <p>If you choose answer 1 (“Leave her be. She´s not hurting anyone.”)<a class="spoiler" id="spoiler_2" name="spoiler_2" href="#spoiler_2"> Xzar´s
      Quest ends.</a></p>
  <p>If you choose answer 2 (“Yeah! Let´s do it!”),<a class="spoiler" id="spoiler_3" name="spoiler_3" href="#spoiler_3"> Xzar
      drains the lifeblood from the Dryad of the Cloudpeaks. She attacks you
      and you must kill her. </a> </p>
  <p><a class="spoiler" id="spoiler_4" name="spoiler_4" href="#spoiler_4">Note:
      If you have Ajantis in your group, he attacks you, too, and you must kill
      him.</a></p>
  <p>After your victory, two Forest Spirits appear and want to ask for help.</p>
  <p>If you enter a wilderness area after a while, <a class="spoiler" id="spoiler_5" name="spoiler_5" href="#spoiler_5">the
      three druids Storm, Zosya and Blackberry appear and attack you. </a> </p>
  <p>You must find a Mithril ring. You can find Mithril rings in many places.
    After you have found the first Mithril ring, talk to Xzar.</p>
  <p><a class="spoiler" id="spoiler_6" name="spoiler_6" href="#spoiler_6">Go
      to the shop "Sorcerous Sundries" in Baldurs Gate and talk with "Halbazzer
      Drin".</a></p>
  <p>If you did want the “Ring of Mental Defence”, choose answer 1 (“Oh, go ahead.”)<a class="spoiler" id="spoiler_7" name="spoiler_7" href="#spoiler_7"> You
      lose a “Mithril ring”, the “Ichor of the Dryad of the Cloudwouds” and 1000
      gold. Come back after 5 days and talk with “Halbazzer Drin” again. He will
      give you the “Ring of Mental Defence”. After you leave the shop, Xzar is
      very happy. </a> </p>
  <p>If you did not want the “Ring of Mental Defence”, choose answer 2 (“No way.
    It´s nowhere near worth it, and we´ve got better stuff already.”) <a class="spoiler" id="spoiler_8" name="spoiler_8" href="#spoiler_8">You
    lose a “Mithrilring” and the “Ichor of the Dryad of the Cloudwouds”. Xzar
    is depressed. </a> </p>
  <p>If you did not want the “Ring of Mental Defence”, but later have changed
    your opinion, <a class="spoiler" id="spoiler_9" name="spoiler_9" href="#spoiler_9">return
    to "Sorcerous Sundries" after 5 days and talk with “Halbazzer Drin” again.
    He will give you the “Ring of Mental Defence” for 500 gold. </a> </p>
  <p><a class="spoiler" id="spoiler_10" name="spoiler_10" href="#spoiler_10"> Note:This
      is your last chance to get the “Ring of Mental Defence”. If you do not
      want him again, you have no other chance. </a> </p>
  <p><a class="spoiler" id="spoiler_11" name="spoiler_11" href="#spoiler_11"> After
      you leave the shop, Xzar is very happy.</a> </p>
  <p>There are some other alternatives, notably the Sewer King (getting his ichor
    will result in new possibilities), and there are some interesting easter
    eggs to look for if you have Xzar and Montaron in your party. Encounters
    with Guards, banter and actions between Montaron and Xzar... "har har har,
    Xzar has a Jar..."</p>

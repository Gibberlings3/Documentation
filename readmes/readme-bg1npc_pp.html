<p>This mod will allow these portraits to be used as player portraits on any Infinity Engine game (including Enhanced Editions) except the original and Enhanced Edition of Planescape: Torment. For games with BG content, the additional components will be available to replace indicidual NPC portraits as appropriate. </p>
<p><strong>Enhanced Edition Note:</strong> Unfortunately, the original portraits were at 110x170. As the Enhanced Editions use larger portraits to support the larger resolutions available, we unfortunately had to upscale the images--as a result, they may be slightly blurry. </p>
<p>There are no known incompatibilities with any mod, however any portrait
  modification mod will overwrite the portrait assignments of portrait mods
  installed previously.</p>

      <p><strong>Special Note for Siege of Dragonspear from Steam/GOG<br />
      </strong>Good Old Games (GOG) and Steam both package the   additional content for Siege of Dragonspear in a method that WeiDU, the   tool used to install this mod, cannot access. You must  run a program   called <a href="https://forums.beamdog.com/discussion/50441/modmerge-merge-your-steam-gog-zip-based-dlc-into-something-weidu-nearinfinity-dltcep-can-use/p1">Modmerge</a> on your SoD installation  before you can install this or any other WeiDU-based mod. </p>
      <p><strong>Enhanced Editions Note</strong><br />
        The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every   patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a   modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as   even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with   your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a   new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. For BG2:EE it is important that you install the mod to the language   version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod   will not show but give error messages. </p>
      <p><strong>Windows</strong><br />
        The BG1 NPC Portrait Pack for Windows is distributed as a self-extracting   archive and includes a WeiDU installer. To install, simply double-click   the archive and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, the files can be extracted into your game directory using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a> or <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-bg1npc_portrait_pack.exe</strong> and the folder<strong> bg1npc_portrait_pack</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-bg1npc_portrait_pack.exe</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-bg1npc_portrait_pack.exe</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>Mac OS X</strong><br />
        The BG1 NPC Portrait Pack  for Mac OS X is distributed as a compressed tarball and includes a WeiDU installer.</p>
      <p>First, extract the files from the tarball into your game directory. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-bg1npc_portrait_pack</strong>, <strong>setup-bg1npc_portrait_pack.command</strong>, and the folder <strong>bg1npc_portrait_pack</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-bg1npc_portrait_pack.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-bg1npc_portrait_pack.command</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>Linux</strong><br />
        The BG1 NPC Portrait Pack  for Linux is distributed as a compressed tarball and does not include a WeiDU installer.</p>
      <p>Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.</p>
      <p>Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="http://www.weidu.org/%7Ethebigg/">WeiDU.org</a> and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal, cd to your game installation directory, run tolower   and answer Y to both queries. You can avoid running the second option   (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save   time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the   first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only   this mod since the last time you lowercased file names. If you're   unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.</p>
      <p>To install, run WeInstall bg1npc_portrait_pack in your game folder. Then run wine BGMain.exe and start playing. </p>
      <p><strong> Note for Complete Uninstallation</strong><br />
        In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely uninstall the mod using setup-bg1npc_portrait_pack --uninstall at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts. . </p>

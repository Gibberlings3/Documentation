    </h2>
    <div class="section">
      This mod is designed to work with Baldur's Gate, with or without the expansion Tales of the Sword Coast. It also supports several conversion projects, <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym>(Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn) with or without the Throne of Bhaal expansion pack, Tutu v4, EasyTutu_SoA, and EasyTutu_ToB. The mod should be compatible with other <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> mods.

      <a name="install" id="install">Installation</a>
    </h2>
    <div class="section">
      <strong>Windows</strong><br />
      The BG1 NPC Portrait Pack is packaged and installed with <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> and is distributed as a self-extracting archive. To install, simply double-click the archive and follow the instructions on screen.<br />
      <br />
      Alternatively the files can be extracted from the archive using <a href= "http://www.rarlab.com/">WinRAR</a>. If properly extracted, you should have a <strong>"bg1npc_portrait_pack"</strong> folder and <strong>setup-bg1npc_portrait_pack.exe</strong> in your game folder. To install, simply double-click <strong>setup-bg1npc_portrait_pack.exe</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.<br />
      <br />
      Please run </strong>setup-bg1npc_portrait_pack.exe</strong> in your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.<br />
      <br />
      <strong>Mac OS X</strong><br />
      <em>If the mod was previously installed, uninstall it before extracting the new version.</em> "bg1npc_portrait_pack" is packaged and installed with <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>. To install, simply extract the contents of the mod into your game folder. If properly extracted, you should have a <strong>"bg1npc_portrait_pack"<strong> folder, <strong>setup-bg1npc_portrait_pack</strong>, and </strong>setup-bg1npc_portrait_pack.command</strong> in your game folder. To install, double-click <strong>setup-bg1npc_portrait_pack.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.<br />
      <br />
      <strong>Linux</strong><br />
Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify. Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="http://www.weidu.org/~thebigg "><acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>.org</a> and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal, cd to your BG2 installation directory, run 'tolower' and answer Y to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only this mod since the last time you lower cased file name. If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.<br />
Run <strong>WeInstall bg1npc_portrait_pack</strong> in your game folder to install the mod. Then run <strong>wine BGMain.exe</strong> and start playing.

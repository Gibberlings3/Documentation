      <p>The <acronym title="Icewind Dale II">IWD2</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Project is a fan-made modification put together for fun, and not for profit. So, don't try to sell it. Two games in particular provided the major source of inspiration for this mod: Baldur's Gate II and Knights of the Old Republic. BioWare developed both of those excellent games. </p>
      <p>The main goal of <acronym title="Icewind Dale II">IWD2</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> is to give an <acronym title="Icewind Dale II">IWD2</acronym> player the opportunity to play with joinable <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> that are not silent. </p>
      <p>The mod is rated <strong>M</strong>, for coarse language and adult situations. You can go to <strong>T</strong> rating if you exclude Salomeya and Sir Wind Nord from the party and tell the eligible characters that you are not interested in their romantic advances. </p>
      <p>Mods which extend material presented here (new <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> for <acronym title="Icewind Dale II">IWD2</acronym> who banter with <acronym title="Icewind Dale II">IWD2</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>s, or romance for one of the <acronym title="Icewind Dale II">IWD2</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>s) are welcome as separate modifications, with the appropriate credit given to the authors. If you want something to become a direct part of this mod, you will need to contact <acronym title="The Gibberlings Three">G3</acronym>. </p>

      <p>There are a few things you need to know before plunging into your Northern adventure with your new companions by your side. IWD2 was never built for conventional NPCs so some design trade-offs had to be made. The IWD2 NPC Project should be fully compatible with Tweaks Anthology, IWD2EE, IWD2 Ease of Use, and other IWD2 mods. </p>
      <p>First, don't forget to patch your game with the <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/files/file/952-official-patches-icewind-dale-ii/">official Patch 2.01</a>. This may not be needed depending on where you get your game, e.g. installing IWD2 from GOG will already include the v2.01 patch. </p>
      <p>There are two ways to play with the new NPCs:</p>
      <p><strong>If you want the party members to recognize a character as the main character</strong>, like the main PC in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG or BG2</acronym>, and banter with him/her you will need to: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Create him or her first. </li>
        <li> Keep him or her in the first, leader's slot. </li>
        <li> Have him or her as the <em>only</em> custom-created (i.e. not supplied by the mod) character. </li>
        <li>Fill the other slots with the new NPCs</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These  limitations are the direct effect of the difference between the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> and <acronym title="Icewind Dale II">IWD2</acronym> engines. If you don't do this, the <acronym title="Icewind Dale II">IWD2</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> will banter between one another and comment on the events in the game, but will not talk to the leader. </p>
      <p><strong>Otherwise you can play with a party of (up to) six of the NPCs</strong>, either by importing the NPCs into the party slots or starting with the premade 'Sir Nord's Company' party and customize from there.</p>
      <p><strong>Other things to keep in mind are: </strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li> The game displays only one portrait during each dialogue in the dialogue window: the portrait of the character talked to. </li>
        <li> So far, the mod is not able to fix the quiet murmur of the characters that fight unarmed. </li>
        <li> The <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym>'s biography cannot be put into the designated spot, so the generic <acronym title="Icewind Dale II">IWD2</acronym> biography will still show there. Your <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym>'s background introduced by the mod, and to which the <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> will refer to, will be written in your journal early in the game. </li>
        <li> If any <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> was petrified, and then restored to life via Stone to Flesh, it will interfere with the character's file, and will eventually cause the game to crash when the character is called upon to say anything. You will need to either re-load and avoid the petrification, or import a new copy of the character via the Character Arbitration screen. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>A note about NPCs in IWD2EE and future development</strong></p>
      <p>IWD2EE adds the ability to have regular, BG- or BG2-style NPCs that can wait  to be recruited, join, leave, hang around after being kicked out, etc. IWD2 NPC currently does not work this way, and is unlikely to change. Converting the current NPCs to the IWD2EE style would require a fair bit of writing and design work, and the original author is gone. In the same vein, crossmod content with the  NPCs added by IWD2EE (or other, future mods) is also unlikely. </p>

      <p><strong>Windows</strong><br />
        The IWD2 NPC Project for Windows is distributed as a self-extracting archive and includes a WeiDU installer. To install, simply double-click the archive and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, the files can be extracted into your game directory using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a> or <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-iwd2npc.exe</strong> and the folder <strong>iwd2npc</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-iwd2npc.exe</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-iwd2npc.exe</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>macOS</strong><br />
        The IWD2 NPC Project for macOS is distributed as a compressed tarball and includes a WeiDU installer.</p>
      <p>First, extract the files from the tarball into your game directory. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-iwd2npc</strong>, <strong>setup-iwd2npc.command</strong>, and the folder <strong>iwd2npc</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-iwd2npc.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-iwd2npc.command</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>Linux</strong><br />
        The IWD2 NPC Project for Linux is distributed as a compressed tarball and does not include a WeiDU installer. Linux users will need to do a one-time install of <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility"><abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr></abbr> (and a few other adjustments) as described in <a href="https://moebiusproject.gitlab.io/mods_on_linux" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">this great writeup</a>. </p>
      <p>To install, run 'WeInstall iwd2npc' in your game folder. </p>
      <p><strong> Note for Complete Uninstallation</strong><br />
        In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely uninstall the mod using setup-iwd2npc --uninstall at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts. </p>

      <p>The IWD2 NPC Project has three separate components:</p>
      <p><strong>Install joinable NPCs for IWD2 </strong></p>
      <p>This is the main component and will make 10 joinable NPCs available. More information is provided in the following sections</p>
      <p><strong>Female Gnome Avatars</strong></p>
      <p> This component lets you select a different avatar for female gnomes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use Female Mage Elf Avatars for Female Mage Gnome Avatars</li>
        <li>Use Female Thief Halfling Avatars for Female Mage Gnome Avatars</li>
        <li>Use Male Mage Dwarf Avatars for Female Mage Gnome Avatars (Game default)</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Use Alternate NWN-Style Portraits for All NPCs</strong></p>
      <p>This component will swap the default, IWD2-style portraits of the ten NPCs with an alternative, NWN-style set of portraits. You can view the original IWD2-style portraits side-by-side with the NWN-style portraits in the <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/gallery/album/35-the-iwd2-npc-project/">IWD2 NPC gallery</a>. </p>

      <p>There are currently 10 joinable <abbr title="Non-Player Characters"><abbr title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</abbr></abbr> available to choose from (full information is available in the <a href="readme-iwd2npc_appendixa.html">included appendix</a>)</p>
      <ul>
        <li> <strong>Diriel</strong>, a Neutral Evil Elven Druid Male (A Romantic Option for an Elven Female PC) </li>
        <li> <strong>Hildury</strong>, a Chaotic Good Half-Orc Barbarian Female </li>
        <li> <strong>Jaemal</strong>, a Neutral Good Aasimar Sorcerer Male (A Romantic Option for a Male or Female PC) </li>
        <li> <strong>Nikosh Bracegirdle</strong>, a True Neutral Halfling Rogue Male </li>
        <li> <strong>(Sir) Wind Nord</strong>, a Lawful Good Human Paladin Male </li>
        <li> <strong>Peony</strong>, a Chaotic Neutral Gnome Wizard-Illusionist Female (A Romantic Option for a Male PC) </li>
        <li> <strong>Prachi</strong>, a Lawful Neutral Human Monk Female </li>
        <li> <strong>Rizdaer</strong>, a Lawful Evil Drow Fighter Male (A Romantic Option for a Female PC) </li>
        <li> <strong>Salomeya</strong>, a Chaotic Evil Half-Elven Bard Female (A Romantic Option for a Male PC) </li>
        <li> <strong>Valeero</strong>, a Neutral Good Human Priestess of Lathander Female </li>
      </ul>
      <p> At the start of the game, you will have two options &ndash; either importing the full pre-created party of 6 <abbr title="Non-Player Characters"><abbr title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</abbr></abbr> which will appear in your party selection menu as &quot;Nord's Company&quot; or you can select &quot;New Party&quot;, create your Protagonist and add 5 <abbr title="Non-Player Characters"><abbr title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</abbr></abbr>. You will handle <abbr title="Non-Player Character"><abbr title="Non-Player Character">NPC</abbr></abbr> joining and removal via Import/Export. </p>
      <p> Each <abbr title="Non-Player Character"><abbr title="Non-Player Character">NPC</abbr></abbr> can be imported at different levels. Sir Nord, Salomeya, Jaemal, Diriel, Valeero and Rizdaer lend themselves more easily to having higher levels at party creation than the PC, Hildury, Peony, Prachi and Nikosh. Suggested levels are: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Level 6: Sir Nord and Valeero </li>
        <li> Level 3: Diriel, Jaemal, Salomeya and Rizdaer </li>
        <li> Level 1: Hildury, Nikosh, Peony and Prachi </li>
      </ul>
      <p> When you are creating the character it is up to you if you want to use the portraits, colors and soundsets that are provided by the mod. Keeping each <abbr title="Non-Player Character"><abbr title="Non-Player Character">NPC</abbr></abbr>'s name as it was given by the mod will save you a bit of confusion when you start seeing the banter. </p>
      <p> PCs will also have some low-power items equipped on them. Your PC will get a small gift as well in the very beginning of the game from Sir Nord (he does not have to be in the party for that). </p>

    <div class="ribbon_triangle_h3-r"></div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>There are five basic types of banter in the mod. </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Scenery banter:</strong> Scenery banter includes interjections into the game texts and short commentary on what's going on. </li>
        <li><strong>Player-initiated dialogues:</strong> Player-initiated dialogues (PID) can be accessed via the &quot;P&quot; button at any time, but its use is mostly utilitarian, allowing you to see a dialogue with an <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> earlier. The option to 'push' the next available banter will only help for those scripted to happen in that particular chapter. In two special cases a <acronym title="Player-Initiated Dialogue">PID</acronym> is used to unlock some extra content. It will show an additional option for Diriel in Fell Forest , and one more for Sir Nord in Chapter 4 if you don't have Salomeya in the party. </li>
        <li><acronym title="Non-Player Character"><strong>NPC</strong></acronym><strong>-<acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> banter:</strong> <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> will talk to one another. These banters are distributed throughout the game and cannot be advanced using the Ctrl+I cheat. You can however press &quot;P&quot; and select one of the options to see if you can 'push' the next available banter. It will only help for banter that is scripted to happen in that particular chapter. Banters scripted to come later will come later. </li>
        <li><strong>Friendship sequences:</strong> All <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> will have two types of banter with your main character (providing you followed the guidelines for main character creation in the &quot;Quirks&quot; section): sequential and event-related. Expect to see roughly one or two sequential dialogues per chapter, and one &quot;long&quot; event related dialogue per chapter. You can press &quot;P&quot; and select one of the options to see if you can 'push' the next available banter with the <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>. It will only help for banter that is scripted to happen in that particular chapter. Banters scripted to come later will come later. </li>
        <li><strong>Romantic Banter:</strong> Five <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> have additional romantic love-talks with the <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym>. Expect roughly two love-talks per chapter. You can press &quot;P&quot; and select one of the options to see if you can 'push' the next available banter with the <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>. It will only help for banter that is scripted to happen in that particular chapter. The love-talks scripted to come later will come later.  Flirts are a special type of the romantic banter. The <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>-initiated flirts will occur independently, increasing in frequency as your romance progresses. <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym>-initiated flirts can be accessed at any time when you are far enough in the romance via hitting the &quot;P&quot; button and selecting the appropriate option. </li>
      </ul>

    <div class="ribbon_rectangle_h3">
      <h3> <a id="contents_romances" name="contents_romances"></a>The Romances</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="ribbon_triangle_h3-l"></div>
    <div class="ribbon_triangle_h3-r"></div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>There are five <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> that you can romance. A male <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym> can romance Jaemal, Salomeya and Peony, while a female PC can romance Diriel (elf only), Rizdaer and Jaemal. You can stop each <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> from romancing you at any time via the <acronym title="Player-Initiated Dialogue">PID</acronym> menu. Additionally, most of the other characters have options in their friendship paths to flirt with them a little. Sometimes they are limited by the <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym>'s race (i.e. you can flirt with Hildury if you are a half-orc). That flirting does not result in a 'full' romance, but will be reflected in the epilogues if you didn't pursue one of the main romances. </p>
      <p>The mod determines whether or not the <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> will romance you based on your character's build and what you say. None of the build parameters is prohibitive (except in Salomeya's case as she will not romance bards), but instead they decrease or increase your chances to romance the character. For example, if your <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym> sports an exotic race (a Drow, Tiefling or Aasimar), it will increase his chances to romance Peony. The match will be determined after your character has the three first talks with the <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> (unless she or he indicates earlier that the romance is undesirable.). </p>
      <p>While each character will take some abuse and insults, especially if s/he can't resist the character you've built, they might eventually lose interest in your <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym> if what you say is not to their taste. </p>
      <p>Other <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> can have romantic designs of their own on either your <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym> or on the romanced <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>, or a romanced <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> might just have troubles choosing between the <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym> and an <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>. They will express their feelings via romantic conflicts. There are two types of romantic conflicts: the interjections into the early romantic dialogues, and  separate banters. The 'main' conflicts (shown in bold for each romance below) will have additional banter and interjections; the 'secondary' conflicts will have interjections only. </p>
      <p><strong>The Conflicts: </strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li> Diriel: <strong>Jaemal</strong>, <strong>Rizdaer</strong>, Salomeya, Nord, Valeero, Prachi </li>
        <li>Jaemal: <strong>Rizdaer</strong>, <strong>Salomeya</strong>, Diriel (elf), Nikosh (halfling or gnome) </li>
        <li>Rizdaer: <strong>Jaemal</strong>, <strong>Peony</strong>, Diriel (elf), Nikosh (halfling or gnome) </li>
        <li>Peony: <strong>Rizdaer</strong>, <strong>Salomeya</strong>, Hildury (half-orc), Prachi </li>
        <li>Salomeya: <strong>Jaemal</strong>, <strong>Peony</strong>, Hildury (half-orc), Prachi </li>
        <li>Jaemal: <strong>Peony</strong>, <strong>Salomeya</strong>, Hildury (half-orc), Prachi </li>

      <p>The mod comes with two sets of portraits, an IWD2-style set of portraits by Dani, and an alternative, NWN-style set of portraits. The IWD2 portraits are used by default, but can be swapped to the NWN-style portraits with the <strong>Use Alternate NWN-Style Portraits for All NPCs</strong> component. </p>
      <p>Regardless, both sets are installed to the portraits folder in your game and will be available in the custom portrait selection during character creation. Whichever set is selected for use by the NPCs will be named after the NPCs (e.g. diriell and diriels, hilduryl and hildurys, etc.) and the set not being used by the NPCs will be named starting with &quot;p#&quot; (e.g. p#diril and p#diris, p#hildl and p#hilds, etc.) If you want to mix-and-match between the two sets, you can customize the portrait for each <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> any time you wish during the game via Customize Appearance option.</p>

      <p>As always, the mod would not have been possible without the friendly gang of Gibberlings and friends. May we gibber for years to come! It's difficult to express just how much help and encouragement I received with this project from the following people: </p>

      <p> <strong>Version 7 - January 26, 2025</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>IWD2EE now has a 'core' component that is used for detection rather than the config file</li>
      </ul>
      <p> <strong>Version: Test Build for v7 - November 12, 2023</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Should be fully compatible with IWD2EE</li>
        <li>Hildury only had her correct bio if she started at level 1</li>
        <li>Valeero's Decorated Helmet had an undocumented +1 armor bonus that has been removed</li>
        <li>Valeero's Decorated Helmet only came with one charge of Sunscorch, despite having a max of 25 charges. It will now start with 25 charges; feedback as to whether this imbalances the early part of the game is appreciated</li>
        <li>Items which cast spells now invoke the underlying spells instead of copying their effects; this allows the items to reflect changes made to the spells by other mods (e.g. IWD2EE)</li>
        <li>Salomeya's Garrote wasn't working well and has been revised. Using Salomeya's Garrote will now create a garrote (once per day) in the magical weapon slot (like Black Blade of Disaster). You then attack your target like a normal melee weapon and the garrote will disappear after a single hit or ten rounds, whichever happens first. </li>
        <li>The language-specific parts of the character and biography files are now derived from the translation files instead of maintaining (literal) scores of redundant files</li>
        <li>Worked on making the alternative avatars for Peony more reliable; previously they were inconsistent about updating the avatar on the inventory screen</li>
        <li>Minor typos in some banter scripting could have been preventing a few banters</li>
        <li>IWD2 NPC was assuming a few dialogues and scripts didn't exist and was creating them without checking; this could potentially overwrite changes from other mods</li>
        <li>For compatibility, more items are copied from current items and altered instead of being created from static files</li>
        <li>Added a new component to select the alternative NWN-style portraits for the NPCs</li>
        <li>Bug fix from paladin84 where one branch of a dialogue was not creating the item it was supposed to</li>
        <li>Updated Russian translation, courtesy of paladin84</li>
        <li>NPC soundsets will now play during character creation. thanks paladin84</li>
        <li>Typo fixes</li>
        <li>Overall modernization of the package: added hooks for Project Infinity, updated readme and appendix (lots of old, broken links), many internal optimizations, removed unused files</li>
      </ul>
      <p> <strong>Version 6 - September 24, 2021, by p_zombie, packed by jastey</strong></p>

        <li>The IWD2NPC\chr directory has been moved to the IWD2NPC\English and IWD2NPC\Russian directories, as it requires translation.</li>

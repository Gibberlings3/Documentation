      <p>Long ago when I was first playing Shadows of Amn, before discovering that mods existed, I came across the Knights of
        Solamnia for the first time in the Planar Sphere and was infinitely disappointed that there was no joinable
        Dragonlance NPC available to accompany you on your adventures. Many years later, I've finally chosen to try to fill
        that hole myself, and you have the results before you now: Evandra the Red, Wizard of High Sorcery.</p>

      <p>The Evandra NPC Mod comes with the following content included:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A new illusionist NPC for BG2</li>
        <li>Content for SoA, ToB, and BG2EE</li>
        <li>Voicing and background music</li>
        <li>Banters with the original Bioware NPCs</li>
        <li>An extensive friendship path</li>
        <li>A unique romance for an elven male protagonist</li>
        <li>Some additional content with the Knights of Solamnia</li>
        <li>Interjections and commentary</li>
      </ul>

          <p><strong>Enhanced Editions Note</strong><br />
            The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod
            setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after
            reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole
            game's folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. For BG2:EE it is important
            that you install the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod
            will not show but give error messages. </p>
          <p><strong>Windows</strong><br />
            Evandra for Windows is distributed as a self-extracting archive and includes a WeiDU installer. To install,
            simply double-click the archive and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
          <p>Alternatively, the files can be extracted into your game directory using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a>
            or <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>. When properly extracted, your game directory will
            contain <strong>setup-evandra.exe</strong> and the folder<strong> evandra</strong>. To install, double-click
            <strong>setup-evandra.exe</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
          <p>You can run <strong>setup-evandra.exe</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change
            components.</p>
          <p><strong>Mac OS X</strong><br />
            Evandra for Mac OS X is distributed as a compressed tarball and includes a WeiDU installer.</p>
          <p>First, extract the files from the tarball into your game directory. When properly extracted, your game directory
            will contain <strong>setup-evandra</strong>, <strong>setup-evandra.command</strong>, and the folder<strong>evandra</strong>.
            To install, double-click <strong>setup-evandra.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
          <p>You can run <strong>setup-evandra.command</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise
            change components.</p>
          <p><strong>Linux</strong><br />
            Evandra for Linux is distributed as a compressed tarball and does not include a WeiDU installer.</p>
          <p>Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.</p>
          <p>Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="http://www.weidu.org/%7Ethebigg/">WeiDU.org</a> and
            copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal, cd to your game installation directory, run
            tolower and answer Y to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran it
            once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the first
            option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only this mod since the last time you lowercased file
            names. If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.</p>
          <p>To install, run WeInstall evandra in your game folder. Then run wine BGMain.exe and start playing. </p>
          <p><strong> Note for Complete Uninstallation</strong><br />
            In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely uninstall the mod using
            setup-evandra --uninstall at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts. . </p>

    <div class="ribbon_rectangle_h2"><a id="Contents" name="Contents"></a>
      <h2>Contents</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="ribbon_triangle_h2-l"></div>
    <div class="ribbon_triangle_h2-r"></div>
    <div class="section">
      <p><i>"You see, on Krynn, the color of a wizard's robes indicates their allegiance: white for good, black for evil, and
          red for those of us who haven't much use for such stupidity one way or the other."</i></p>
      
      <p>Evandra is a True Neutral elven illusionist, and for those familiar with the Dragonlance setting, a Red Robed Wizard
        of High Sorcery. Given her elven background, her alignment in some senses represents a fall--a significant departure
        from what she had at one point expected out of life. Expect her to be something of a bright mirror of Viconia in
        tone.</p>
      
      <p>Evandra can be found inside the Planar Sphere prior to Chapter 4, trapped with the Knights of Solamnia. She is
        immediately recruitable. Please note that the Mage Stronghold option to return the Solamnics to their homeworld is no
        longer available, though players of all classes will be able to resolve their situation eventually.
      
      </p>
      <h2>Friendship & Romance</h2>
      <div class="section">
        <p>The Evandra NPC mod includes a friendship track that spans both Shadows of Amn and Throne of Bhaal. It will begin
          soon after escaping the Planar Sphere, and continue throughout chapters 2 and 3. Several dialogues will only
          trigger in Athkatla, and the penultimate one triggers upon rest. Be warned that Evandra's normal friendship track
          will no longer be available after leaving for Spellhold, so recruiting her as soon as possible is recommended.</p>
      
        <p>Evandra will befriend a protagonist of any race, gender, or alignment, but another elf will have access to a fair
          amount of unique content, including the possibility of a romance once the friendship track is concluded. Romantic
          content will begin upon reaching Spellhold and continue throughout chapters 4 and 5.</p>
      
        <p>Much of the content in Throne of Bhaal triggers in specific places, whether outdoors at night, in the Pocket
          Plane, or in Amkethran. If the track seems stalled, consider visiting one of these places. Also be aware that the
          second romance talk in the expansion triggers upon rest.</p>
      
        <p>Romance Requirements:</p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Gender:</strong> Evandra will only romance a male protagonist.</li>
            <li><strong>Race:</strong> Evandra will only romance elves.</li>
            <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> No restrictions.</li>
            <li><strong>Class restrictions:</strong> No restrictions.</li>
            <li><strong>Stat restrictions:</strong> INT 12+.</li>
          </UL>

      <p>The modding community for the Infinity Engine has been going strong for
        more than 10 years now, and is the culmination of thousands of unpaid modding
        hours by fellow fans of the game. Modders produce their best work and players
        get the best, well-supported mods when we all work together. </p>
      <p> There are two big ways to upset this harmony. One is to claim someone else's
        work as your own. The second is to host and redistribute a mod without permission
        from the author(s). </p>
      <p> Be kind to your fellow players and modders. Don't do either. </p>

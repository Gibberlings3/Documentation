			Ajantis BG1 Expansion Modification 
	for BG1 (with or without TotSC), BG1Tutu v4, EasyTutu, BGT and BG:EE
					by jastey 


This is a mini-mod for original ("vanilla") Baldur’s Gate 1 game (with or without the add-on Tales of the Sword Coast), BG1Tutu v4, EasyTutu, Baldur’s Gate Trilogy (BGT), Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition (BG:EE), and Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET).

For original BG1 (with or without TotSC), the mod adds a friendship track and the BG1NPC project romance for Ajantis. The original BG1NPC project romance was slightly altered to adjust to the restrictions of the BG1 engine, although overall the content stayed the same.

For Tutu, BGT, BG:EE, and EET, the mod adds a friendship track and more romance content for the BG1NPC Project romance for Ajantis. Content-wise, the mod is meant as an addition to the BG1NPC project, but technically it can be installed and played without the BG1NPC project.

For EE, the mod also adds several banters with Rassad and one with Baeloth, as well as a Rasaad-Ajantis romance conflict.

For SoD, the mod adds farewell dialogues before Ajantis leaves. In romance case the PC will get three letters from Ajantis along the SoD campaign.
In romance case his original farewell "DisplayStringHead" lines in Korlasz' Crypt will be deactivated.
For non-romance case his origial farewell lines "DisplayStringHead" about going to Waterdeep were tweaked in consistency with BGII: Ajantis will now say that he will travel to the Order in Athkatla.

The BG1NPC project can be found at the Gibberlings Three site: http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg1npc/index.php

For BG:EE and EET there will be a second install option to use the existent BAM for Ajantis' shield (green dragon on golden back), if BG1NPC is installed.


NOTE: The alternate portrait choices are now in a separate modification: Ajantis' Portrait Pack. 

Version 11 comes with new content. German and English versions are complete. The French version has the new texts in English, for now.


GENERAL INFORMATION 

Romance (BG1 and BG1:TotSC only): if you want to start the player initiated dialogues (or flirts for the romance) with Ajantis, select him and press "k".

Friendship path: the friendship dialogues are available to all PCs. However, if the PC matches the romance conditions, the romance will be triggered instead (for Tutu/BGT/BG:EE via BG1NPC Project only: component Ajantis romance has to be installed. If "Ajantis romance" from the BG1NPC project is not installed, the full friendship path will trigger instead). In this case, the friendship will resume only if the romance was interrupted no later than LT 10 ("Lady <CHARNAME>, may I share my thoughts with you?...") via player-initiated dialogue (PID) or by the PC comitting to another man. For Tutu/BGT with "Ajantis romance" installed, the PID option to end the romance will be available only after the third lovetalk (the one about Helm).

Two of the dialogues that are triggered by game events of the friendship path will also trigger for an active romance.

For BG1 and BG1:TotSC, this mod uses "Zed Nocear's BG1 Trigger-Simulations" (http://forums.gibberlings3.net/index.php?s=&showtopic=13858&view=findpost&p=119631). Many thanks to Zed Nocear for making these workarounds available, so that simulating numerous standard BGII triggers became possible!

WARNING for original BG1 and BG1:TotSC players: *after* installing the Ajantis for BG1 mod, do not import for your PC a character that was exported from a modded game using Zed Nocear's BG1 trigger simulations, as it would break the "party rested" detection for the morning dialogue(s).

For more information, please have a look at the files "BG1_Romance_Guide" (for the BG1 romance) and "Friendship Path Guide" (for the friendship path); both files are located in the folder "AjantisBG1/install".

The file Translation_Guide.txt gives a list about which text lines are the same in BG1NPC Project, hopefully to save some translation time for the one mod or the other.

INSTALLATION
 
Currently, only the Windows version of the mod exists. Using the correct install method, it should be working on MAC OS X and Linux installs, too.

Extract the contents of the archive to your game's main directory. 

If you use BG Enhanced Edition from GOG or Steam, you need to prepare your game before installing any mods:

(deprecated tool: 
https://forums.beamdog.com/discussion/50441/modmerge-merge-your-steam-gog-zip-based-dlc-into-something-weidu-nearinfinity-dltcep-can-use/p1)

Run the "Setup-AjantisBG1" program. Choose the language you prefer and confirm installation. This should extract all needed files to the override folder.

NOTE: BG(II):EE are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. 

For BG1, it is recommended to start a new game after you install the mod. Ajantis will have his family shield, and the non-enemy detection as condition for dialogue triggering will work as intended. Technically, the mod could be played from a saved game without any game breaking behavior, though.

If you have installation problems, or if you encounter any bugs, please contact me via e-mail (jastey@web.de), or post it at Kerzenburgforum http://kerzenburg.baldurs-gate.eu/showthread.php?t=42482. 

Alternatively, if you prefer an English forum, you can find me at the Gibberlings Three Forums: (http://forums.gibberlings3.net/).

COMPATIBILITY

The Ajantis BG1 Expansion Mod is coded using WeiDU, and it does not overwrite any files. The BG1 version patches all area scripts. It should be compatible with most other (WeiDU) mods.
Install order is after BG1NPC Project.


I want to thank all who have helped me making this mod.

Have fun playing the Ajantis expansion mod!

Version 2


In order to let German and Italian gamers enjoy this mod, we repackaged it and included the translations. Of course, we'll take it down as soon as either Barren updates the mod or asks for it to be taken down.

1.  General Info.

This is my small contributin to JCompton's one-day NPC project. It makes Anishai, the monk from Mae'Var's guildhouse, a joinable NPC.

2.  Installation.

1. Extract the contents of this .zip file to the main BG2 directory.
2. Click on the 'Setup-Anishai.exe' (or invoke it from the command line).
3. Select 'Y(es)' install and let WeiDU do its magic.

3.  Thanks.

JCompton, the instigator of this project
Ghreyfain, whose tutorials were very helpful
Westley Weimer, for the great tool that is Weidu
PhroXenGold, because I took Anishai's portrait from his site
Roland the Druid, who tried to help me when I lost some files

Special thanks to Icelus, an inspiration to modders everywhere

4.  Spoilers.

To get Anishai in your party, just visit the second floor of Mae'Var's guildhouse after everyone's gone hostile, and pick the right dialog choices. She's a Chaotic Neutral lv 10 monk with 14 str, 17 dex, 10 con, 13 int, 9 wis and 16 cha. She carries a dagger, whose properties are not completely known, even to Anishai herself. It seems to strike as a +3 weapon, and deal poison damage.

4.  Spoilers.

To get Anishai in your party, just visit the second floor of Mae'Var's guildhouse after everyone's gone hostile, and pick the right dialog choices. She's a Chaotic Neutral lv 10 monk with 14 str, 17 dex, 10 con, 13 int, 9 wis and 16 cha. She carries a dagger, whose properties are not completely known, even to Anishai herself. It seems to strike as a +3 weapon, and deal poison damage.

<h2>Notes</h2> 
<div class="section"> 
  <p><acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> is rated T for Teen. </p> 
  <p>The Sarah <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Romance Mod

    material. Please do not play this mod if this type of content offends you.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2> 
<div class="section"> 
  <p>It has always been a belief of mine that there are not enough rangers in
    Baldur's Gate II, nor are there enough opportunities to interact with them.
    This mod will add Sarah, a young but independent ranger to Baldur's Gate
    II.</p>

  <p>This mod is designed to work with Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn with
    or without the Throne of Bhaal expansion pack. There are currently no known
    incompatibilities. </p>

<h2>Contents</h2> 
<div class="section"> 
  <p>Sarah is a young but independent woman who was born in the slums of Baldur's
    Gate. She was raised by her father until he met an untimely death at the
    hands of a mugger when she was thirteen. Sent to live with her uncle, a ranger,
    in the Cloakwood Forest, Sarah learned the ways of nature as well as the
    art of combat. Years later, she left the Cloakwood to explore on her own.
    She settled in an empty cabin not too far from Umar Hills, and has helped
    guide lost merchants and other travelers ever since. Sarah is a relatively
    shy but determined person who admits to loving nature more than people, but
    then again, perhaps she just hasn't found the right person yet. You can find
    Sarah in the northeastern section of the Umar Hills region (AR1100).</p>

  <p><strong>Biography</strong></p> 
  <p>When asked about her past, SARAH tells you that she hails from the slums
    of Baldur's Gate, where she raised by her father until he met an untimely
    death at the hands of a mugger when Sarah was thirteen. She was taken in
    by her father's brother, a ranger of the Cloakwood Forest, who taught her
    all he knew of nature and combat. She admits to preferring the company of
    trees over people, but that she has never hesitated to help anyone in need.
    While she claims she is unremarkable and ordinary, you wonder if there is
    more to her than meets the eye.</p>

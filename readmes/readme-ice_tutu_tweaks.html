    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> CamDawg, DavidW</p>
  <p><strong> Version 7.0</strong><br />
    <strong> Languages:</strong> English<br />
    <strong> Platforms: </strong>Windows</p>
</div>
<h2>Overview</h2> 
<div class="section"> 
  <p> This mod includes the latest fixes for the Icewind Dale in Baldur's Gate II mod, which converts Icewind Dale to run on the Baldur's Gate engine. It also contains
  a number of small tweaks for IWD-in-BG2, including a basic collection of joinable NPCs and a few options to configure whether Icewind Dale treats your primary character as special.</p>
</div>
<h2> Compatibility </h2>
<div class="section">
  <p> Unsurprisingly, the IWD-in-BG2 Fixpack/Tweakpack requires the Icewind Dale in Baldur's Gate II conversion. It should be installed immediately after the conversion has run.</p>
</div>
<h2> Languages </h2>
<div class="section"> 
  <p> At present, the Fixpack/Tweakpack is in English only. However, iwith the exception of the joinable NPCs, it should be perfectly useable in any language.</p>
</div>

<h2> Installation </h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>
  Just run the executable and fill in the location of your IWD-in-BG2 folder.
  </p>
     </div>

<div class="section">
<h3>Section I: Fixpack</h3>
<p>This section has only one component: the Fixpack for the converter. This must be run straight after the converter itself has run.</p>
<h3>Section II: Weapon Proficiencies</h3>
<p>This section again has only one component, which allows you to customise how the weapon proficiencies in IWD-in-BG2 work. By default, the proficiency system 
in IWD-in-BG2 works just as in BG2 itself. This component allows you to use something closer to either the BG1 or IWD systems.</p>
<p>There are seven options. The first is
a custom option designed by CamDawg, that tries to achieve a balance between the BG and IWD weapon systems. The others are hopefully self-explanatory: you can choose the BG1 system with or without BG2 weapon styles, or the IWD system. In each case there are two available versions.
Choose the "save unsafe" version (which is better) unless you already have a game in progress.</p>
<h3>Section III: Basic NPCs</h3>
<p><strong>Install NPCs</strong></p>
<p>This component introduces 12 joinable NPCs into IWD-in-BG2, built from the existing game's soundsets and portraits. These are <b>basic</b> NPCs, at about the level
of BG1 NPCs. In other words, they have joining dialogue and not a lot else. They don't have banter, romances, quests or the like. (One or two make a very occasional interjection.) However, they're available as a basic party if you want one (and don't want to use Kulyok's Icewind Dale NPCs for any reason).</p>
<p>The full list of NPCs is as follows:
<ul>
<li>Ragnar, lawful good male dwarven fighter (in the tavern in Easthaven)</li>
<li>Marcus, neutral evil male human assassin (in the Snowdrop Inn in Easthaven)</li>
<li>Vilmar, chaotic good male human barbarian (in the Temple of Tempus in Easthaven)</li>
<li>Endricane, neutral male good human priest of Lathander (on the western lakeshore in Easthaven)</li>
<li>Eloise, chaotic good female half-elven thief/mage (upstairs in the room above Pomab's shop, in Easthaven)</li>
<li>Ilauna, neutral good female human mage (in Orrick the Grey's tower in Kuldahar; talk to Orrick to recruit her)</li>
<li>Moranir, true neutral male human avenger (near the druid statue in Kuldahar)</li>
<li>Morgana, chaotic neutral female half-elven bard (in the tavern in Kuldahar)</li>
<li>Syleen, lawful good female human undead hunter (in the tavern in Kuldahar)</li>
<li>Arris Carthimon, chaotic good male elven sorceror (in Oswald's airship in Kuldahar)</li>
<li>Elyvir Blacksheaf, chaotic good female elven archer (in the inn in Kuldahar)</li>
<li>Kori Fire-Eye, lawful good female dwarven fighter/cleric (in the smithy in Kuldahar)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The choice of NPC race/class/kit is based on a combination of what the IWD portraits and soundsets seemed to suggest,
what BG2 kits I thought it would be fun to showcase in IWD-in-BG2, and whim. (I wrote this ages ago when I realised I'd need a proper party for testing.)
</p>
<p><strong>Remove NPC soundsets</strong></p>
<p>This component removes the soundsets assigned to the joinable NPCs from the character-creation screen. (This is just so you don't accidentally pick one of them.)</p>
<p><strong>NPCs get basic interjections based on existing IWD content</strong></p>
Icewind Dale has a surprising number (about 450) of dialog options tied to the particular race, class or alignment of the character doing the talking; unless you
play many times, you'll miss most of them. This component turns many of these options into NPC interjections, tied to one or other of the basic NPCs in the tweakpack.</p>
<p>The distribution of interjections is a bit uneven, because IWD itself is very uneven in how much love it gives to each character class. The rough number of lines for each NPC is as follows (in decreasing order):
<ul>
<li>Syleen 20</li>
<li>Endricane 18</li>
<li>Moranir 10</li>
<li>Elyvir 9</li>
<li>Arris 9</li>
<li>Marcus: 9</li>
<li>Eloise: 7</li>
<li>Ragnar: 7</li>
<li>Kori 6</li>
<li>Morgana 4</li>
<li>Vilmar 2</li>
<li>Ilauna 1</li>
</ul>
<p>This hopefully brings the NPCs a bit more to life (and showcases some IWD content you wouldn't necessarily get to see otherwise), though they're still pretty basic compared to standard BG2 NPCs (or to Kulyok's Icewind Dale NPCs).
</p>
<h3>Section IV: BG2-style protagonist options</h3>
<p><strong>Game ends when the main character dies</strong></p>
<p>By default, in IWD-in-BG2 - as with the original IWD - the game ends only when the whole party is killed. If you install this component, the game instead behaves like Baldur's Gate: if your main character dies, it's game over.</p>
<p><strong>NPCs respond to the main character, not to whichever character talks to them.</strong></p>
<p>By default, in IWD-in-BG2 - as with the original IWD - people you talk to address their comments to whichever party member started the conversation.
If you install this component, the game instead behaves like Baldur's Gate: all NPCs talk to your main character, even if you initiate conversation using some other character.</p>
<h3>Section V: miscellaneous tweaks</h3>
<p><strong>Spawns are always at maximum difficulty</strong></p>
<p>This component (which in due course should be hived off into a tactical mod) ensures that random groups of level-dependent creatures spawn as if your party
was the highest available level.</p>
<p><strong>Add map notes to towns</strong></p>
<p>This component makes towns (Kuldahar, Easthaven, Lonelywood) behave the same way as in BG2: the map is cleared and significant locations are marked with map pins.</p>
<p><strong>Make Heart of Winter accessible at any level</strong></p>
<p>With this component installed, Hjollder will no longer refuse to take you to Lonelywood if you are too-low level.</p>
<p><strong>Restore BG2 spells and make scrolls available</strong></p>
<p>By default, IWD-in-BG2 contains only Icewind Dale spells: no Contingencies, Timestops, and the like. This component restores the BG2 spells not already found in Icewind Dale. (Spells that function differently in IWD continue to function differently.</p>
<p>The component also places exactly one scroll of each restored wizard spell in a store. Spells of level 6 or below are found in Orrick the Grey's store. Higher-level spells
are distributed randomly between Edion, Bandoth, Kieran, and Nym.</p>
<p>Note that the BG2 spells have a different artistic style from the IWD spells, which may appear jarring.</p>
<p>The "Find Familiar" spell <b>is</b> restored, but I don't recommend using it. The familiars summoned will be over-powerful for the early stages of the game, and will make
dialog comments appropriate to BG2, not IWD. (In a future version I'll look at adapting them better.</p>
<p><strong>Never lose access to Orrick the Grey's trade goods</strong></p>
<p>This component allows you to ask Orrick to show you his earlier goods, once he's moved on to offering you higher-quality stuff.</p>

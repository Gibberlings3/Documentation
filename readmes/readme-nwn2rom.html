<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="section">
<p>The Romance Pack for the Neverwinter Nights 2 Official Campaign and Mask of the Betrayer Expansion adds romance and flirts to your NWN2 game. It offers flirts for Bishop, Casavir, Elanee, Neeshka, Gann, and Safiya; full romantic tracks for Bishop and Casavir; and a Castle Wall scene for Bishop and Neeshka. It also features romantic epilogues for the four OC characters in the Mask of the Betrayer Expansion (MotB) portion of the game.</p>
<p>WARNING: You character interpretation may differ from the mod authors’.
</p>
</div>
<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<div class="section">
<p>To ensure compatibility this mod incorporates 3 earlier mods released separately: Bishop’s Romance, MotB-Mule Pack and Requiem-MotB. If you have these mods currently installed, please DELETE them before installing this package.</p>
<p>This mod is designed to work with NWN2-OC and  MotB expansion pack. Due to the nature of the Electron Engine, the mod will be incompatible with any other mod using the same NWN2-OC files. Any and all mods for NWN2-OC-MotB that will want to use the same files and want to maintain the compatibility are free to take the OC-MotB files modified by this mod and apply further changes to them.
</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p><strong>The NWN2-OC-MotB Romance Pack comes with two zip files.</strong><br />
The NWN2-OC-MotB Romance Pack comes with two zip files. The <strong>FP_V1.7z</strong> file has to be un-zipped into your <br />

<br />
and the <strong>FP_Music.7z</strong> file has to be un-zipped into your <br />

</div>
<h2>Content</h2>
<div class="section">
<p>This is a modification for the NWN2-OC that adds new dialogues, expansions to the existing dialogues and the flirt-pack for Bishop and Casavir, as well as the Wall scene for Neeshka, and flirts for all 6 romanceable characters (Bishop, Casavir, Neeshka, Gann and Saffiya).  </p>
<p> Flirt-packs are accessed via the main question menu, where the new option (Flirt with …) will appear. The flirts differ between acts or between the different stages of the relationship. The mod does not modify the influence over the characters, in order not to upset the game’s balance. The first lines of NWN1-style talks are voiced in Bishop’s Romance-OC, and the cutscenes with Neeshka and Bishop are fully voiced. Neeshka’s cutscene occurs if influence with her is higher than with Elanee.
</p>
<p> <strong>Bishop Romance Specific Information:</strong> Two or three talks are ‘hidden’ and will appear if certain events occurred and you tried to flirt with Bishop. You do not have to be evil-aligned or have high influence with Bishop to romance him. The last meeting with Bishop still requires high influence with him to eventually obtain a different conclusion.
</p>
<p> <strong>Casavir Romance Specific Information:</strong> Several talks are ‘hidden’ and will appear if certain events occurred and you talk with Casavir. Additionally, if you missed a lovetalk, you can get it by talking to Casavir. You do not have to be good-aligned or have high influence with Casavir to romance him, however his reaction to some of the more aggressive flirts are more favorable if you are not evil and if you have a high influence with him. You can end the romance voluntarily by telling him that you do not appreciate all the attention (or by choosing suitably offensive replies) and restart it by telling him you are sorry for the misunderstanding, however the latter requires an influence of 5 or higher in Act 2 and 10 or higher in Act 3. Please note that the romance expansion does not disable any original content, so certain game events are still going to occur. You can always turn him down. Should you come to a point where you feel the testimony of a paladin might help you, and should you decide that you want Casavir to say a few words on your behalf, talk to Sand.
</p>
<p>
<strong>New Epilogues:</strong> <br />
 We have added a number of new Epilogues in MotB for the OC romantic characters. In order to see the conclusions of your love-story for Casavir, Elanee and Neeshka, you need to reject the MotB love interest and specify which OC character you romanced; talk to Ammon Jerro and express hope that the loved one is alive. In Bishop’s case, you will need to prompt him to hold on to his life in the Wall scene and bargain with Kelemvor.

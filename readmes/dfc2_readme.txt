+) Section 1. About
===================
  Dat File Converter 2 (dfc2) is a small tool to convert the .dat files used by DLTCEP/IEEP etc to html files, in the same format as used in the IESDP. The converter works with the .dat files for BG1, BG2, PST, IWD1 and IWD2 (in fact the converter works for all files using the .dat format).

+) Section 2. (un)Installation
==============================
To install DFC2 simply unzip DFC2(xx).zip (where (xx) represents the version of DFC2). Popular unzipping tools include Winzip (http://www.winzip.com/) and Filzip (http://www.filzip.com/). Once the files are extracted you can place them wherever you like. Files included in the distribution are:
  readme.txt - this file
  dfc2.exe - the dcf2 executable

To uninstall DFC2 just delete the files you extracted from dfc2[xx].zip. The DFC2 distribution includes no external dll files, and creates no registry entries.

+) Section 3. Usage
===================
DFC2 runs as a console application, so there is not much of a GUI. The 2 ways of running DFC2 are:
  i) Interactive (not included in this version)
    Just run (double-click) DFC2 in Windows Explorer.

  ii) Command-line
    DFC2 can be run from the command-line (shortcut, run dialog, DOS box, batch file). Usage in this mode is:
      DFC2 input.ext output.ext

+) Section 4. Known Issues
==========================
The resultant html files are aligned for 640*480 displays, though rarely the text will spread beyond this limit. This is to prevent words being broken in mid-word. This is unlikely to change.

If you find any errors, please let me know immediately, specifying as much as you can about your problem.

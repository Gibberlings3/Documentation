<h2>Sword Coast Stratagems Component: Tougher Chapter Two End Battle</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p> This is the fight with Mulahey at the bottom of the Nashkel Mine. </p>
  <p> Mulahey's hit points are improved, and he gets some Strength of One spells
    and scripting to use them. Mulahey's tough kobold allies are redesignated
    as "Kobold Elites" and improved a bit. The allies that he summons later in
    the fight are beefed up a bit too. </p>
  <p>If "Dark Side-Based Kobold Upgrade" is installed, the kobold elites get
    poisoned daggers and the summoned allies include some kobold guards. </p>
</div>
<h2>Sword Coast Stratagems Component: Tougher Chapter Three End Battle</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p> This is the fight with the Iron Throne adventurers in Tazok's tent. </p>
  <p> Britik the gnoll gets a strength potion and a slight level increase. A
    few Black Talons and Chill are added to the tent. </p>
  <p>Most importantly, if you talked your way into the bandit camp, by the time
    you get out you'll find that Taugosz has smelled a rat, and you may have
    to fight your way out. </p>
</div>
<h2>Sword Coast Stratagems Component: Tougher Chapter Four End Battle</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p> The confrontation with Davaeorn at the bottom of the Cloakwood mine. </p>
  <p>The battle horrors, instead of being summoned by traps, are there already.
    They're enchanted to be immune to fire, lightning and web (I'm following
    pen-and-paper rules here, more or less.) </p>
  <p>More importantly, <em>if</em> the Smarter Mages component is installed,
    Davaeorn benefits from it: he has a modified script which combines features
    of his original teleport-around script with the Smarter Mages script. </p>
</div>
<h2>Sword Coast Stratagems Component: Tougher Chapter Five End Battle</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p> The six acolytes are left alone (though if you are using the Smarter Mages/Priests/general 
  <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> components
    you'll notice a big effect). However, they are joined by two new acolytes:
    a half-elven fighter/thief and a human thief, who begin the battle invisible.
    You get some warning of the change if you read the dialogues lower down the
    tower carefully. 
</div>
<h2>Sword Coast Stratagems Component: Tougher Chapter Six End Battle</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p> Each adventurer in Prat's party gains two levels. The party starts the
    battle invisible and supported by a couple of air elementals. </p>

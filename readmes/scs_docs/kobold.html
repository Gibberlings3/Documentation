<h1>Sword Coast Stratagems Component: Dark Side-Based Kobold Upgrade</h1>
<div class="section">
  <p> Basically, some of the kobolds get a one-use script which causes them to
    spawn several more kobolds (the exact number is randomised and keyed to chapter).
    Among the newly-spawned kobolds are "guards" (who wield poisoned daggers).
    In addition, a kobold ambush force is spawned close to the exit to <acronym title="Level Three">L3</acronym> of
    the mines--it includes a kobold chieftain and a couple of shamans. </p>

<h1>Sword Coast Stratagems Component: Harder Spiders</h1>
<div class="section">
<p> Giant spiders get the ability to cast webs once every four rounds (it's randomised,
  so they don't automatically do it in the first round you meet them).</p>
<p> Phase spiders can hear calls for help from their allies anywhere on the map,
  and may teleport in to investigate; they may also decide randomly to teleport
  to the party even if they are far away.</p>

<h1>Sword Coast Stratagems Component: Improved Demon Cultists</h1>
<div class="section">
  <p> The cult consists of:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Cult Guards: 8th level fighters. Their hit points are increased from
      39 to 65; otherwise they're left alone. <em>But</em> note that 8th level
      fighters usually get pretty good battle potions from Smarter Potions.</li>
    <li>Cult Archers: originally 8th level thief archers, they're changed into
      8th level fighters (more hit points and better battle potions).</li>
    <li>Cult Assassins: 8th level fighter/thieves. They get extra hit points
      and a stack of Invisibility potions (they'll only use them if you have
      Improved General <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> installed).</li>
    <li>Cult Wizards: originally 3rd level wizards (in practice), they become
      8th level and get Wands of Paralysis (a surprisingly nasty weapon in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym>).</li>
    <li>Cult Enforcers: in the original game they're actually listed as high-level
      fighter-mages, but they don't use any of their fighter-mage powers. I take
      their classification seriously: they are now 15th/15th level fighter-mages,
      though with only <acronym title="Level Five">L5</acronym> spells and below, and they use their Wands of Frost.
      These guys are very dangerous.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  The demon Aec'Letec isn't modified (it's already seriously dangerous) but Tracea
  Carrol, previously a weakling wizard (c. <acronym title="Level Six">L6</acronym>), is now 11th level. In addition,
  the six cultists from whom Aec'Letec draws strength will now defend themselves.
  All in all, this makes the final battle with Aec'Letec pretty tough. I recommend
  the use of Arrows of Dispelling on your own party to dispel Aec'Letec's Death
  Gaze.

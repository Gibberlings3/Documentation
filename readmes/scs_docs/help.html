<h1>Sword Coast Stratagems Component: Better Calls For Help</h1>
<div class="section">
  <p> Roughly speaking, the help script works like this. Suppose some hostile
    creature - say, an Orc - runs into Player 3. He then Shouts something that
    could be translated as "I'm an Orc and I can see player 3!", and sets an
    internal variable that means "I'm running towards player 3!".</p>
  <p> Any orc who hears that shout also sets that same internal variable. If
    orcs are counted as "intelligent" (like kobolds and gnolls, for instance,
    but unlike wolves and spiders), the new orc gives a different shout, which
    could be translated as "I'm an orc and I've just heard another orc shout
    for player 3!".</p>
  <p> Any orc who hears the <em>new</em> shout sets the internal variable to
    say "I'm running towards player 3", but doesn't in turn shout - in playtesting
    it turned out that too many repeated Shouts just cause everything in the
    map to run towards the player, which leads to one exciting fight followed
    by a very long tedious exploration of an empty dungeon. There are a couple
    of exceptions though: the Bandit camp, for instance.</p>
  <p> Finally, everyone who has an internal variable set to "run towards player
    3" does so - <strong>if</strong> they can't see any hostiles.</p>
  <p> There are fairly obvious ways to abuse this, but they don't tend to come
    up unless you actively try to set them up.</p>
  <p> The full list of monsters affected, grouped into those groups which respond
    to each others' cries for help, is:</p>
  <p> Stupid creatures:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Basilisks</li>
    <li>Dogs</li>
    <li>Spiders and ettercaps (arguably these creatures aren't "stupid", just
      not organised beyond small groups)</li>
    <li>Wolves (also hear werewolf cries)</li>
    <li>Wyverns</li>
  </ul>
  <p> Intelligent creatures: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Bandits</li>
    <li>The demon cultists in Ulgoth's Beard</li>
    <li>Gibberlings</li>
    <li>Gnolls</li>
    <li>Hobgoblins</li>
    <li>Kobolds</li>
    <li>Ogres</li>
    <li>Tasloi</li>
    <li>Undead</li>
    <li>Werewolves (also hear wolf cries)</li>
    <li>Xvarts (and Ursa!)</li>
    <li>&amp; the mixed bag of (mostly human) creatures who use the Shout script</li>
  </ul>
  <p> There is also a specific script for Slythe and Krystin, to make sure that
    they seek out the player once the fight starts (otherwise they have a tendency
    to get lost.) </p>

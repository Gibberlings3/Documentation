<h1>Sword Coast Stratagems Component: Smarter Mages</h1>
<div class="section">
  <p> The mages who are given specific scripts by the patch are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Natasha and some ogre magi (get told not to worry about zapping their
      own allies with area-effect).</li>
    <li>Tarnesh (gets Sleep in place of one <acronym title="Magic Missile")</li>
    <li>Mutamin (tries to dispel the party's Protection from Petrification magic)</li>
    <li>Centeol (has presumably lost her magic, but might as well use the Wand
      of Frost)</li>
    <li>Lendarn and the Firewine Bridge ogre mage (get a co-ordinated battle
      script)</li>
    <li>Niemain (risks area effect on the entrance to his lair)</li>
    <li>Davaeorn (gets a dedicated set of teleport-and-attack instructions, and
      automatically has Battle Horror flunkies)</li>
    <li>Andris (teleports away, re-buffs, returns)</li>
  </ul>

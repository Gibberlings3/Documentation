<h1>Sword Coast Stratagems Component: Improved Miscellaneous Encounters</h1>
<div class="section">
  <p> The full list is:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Laurel the paladin's gibberling hunt. As it stands this is a ridiculous
      encounter - the "horde" of gibberlings is tiny. I've quadrupled their number
      - it's still not a difficult fight, but it's a more realistic one.</li>
    <li>The Cloakwood druids. They're a pushover to a well-played party - each
      gets a couple of levels and some apprentices.</li>
    <li>Tamoko and Bassilus. These solo priests are also pushovers - they gain
      a few levels (they're still not that tough).</li>
    <li>Drasus's party. The party guarding the entrance to the Cloakwood mine
      gains a couple of levels.</li>
    <li>The Red Wizards of Thay each gain three levels (they don't get any new
      spells in their CRE files, but the <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> will pick up on their level and adjust
      their defences accordingly).</li>
    <li>Cythandria, Sarevok's paramour, is currently guarded by a pair of hopeless
      ogres; they're replaced by Stone Golems.</li>
    <li>Slythe the assassin gains a level (which brings his backstab into quadruple-damage
      territory). He also slugs a potion of invulnerability, and receives a Non-Detection
      spell, before the battle starts.</li>
    <li>The Iron Throne assassins you meet in the Undercity each gain a couple
      of levels (making this party a pretty serious threat, actually).</li>
  </ul>

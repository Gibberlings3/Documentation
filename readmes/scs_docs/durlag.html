<h1>Sword Coast Stratagems Component: Improved Durlag's Tower</h1>
<div class="section">
  <p> Four fights are modified:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The battle with "Love", "Pride", "Avarice", and "Fear" on the first dungeon
      level. They get extra hit points and/or regenerative capability, and three
      get improved magic powers.</li>
    <li>The doppelgangers on the second dungeon level-- they are instructed to
      use their specific powers a bit more effectively. (This mostly affects
      Islanne's doppelgangers; it won't be all that effective without Smarter
      Mages).</li>
    <li>The duplicates that can emerge from the Mirror have been upgraded slightly.</li>
    <li>The chessboard battle has been significantly upgraded and is now quite
      difficult. The chess constructs have gained a variety of immunities (electricity,
      normal weapons, mind-affecting magic) to represent their status as constructs
      rather than humans; the pawns have gained more hit points. The King is
      now a 9th/7th level fighter/mage and the Queen is an 11th level mage. <br />
      (For what it's worth, my own solution to the fight was to refuse to play
      the chessboard game: make everyone immune to lightning and just go where
      you want. You should have enough potions of absorption by this stage.)</li>
  </ul>

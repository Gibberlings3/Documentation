<h1>Sword Coast Stratagems Component: Improved Balduran's Isle</h1>
<div class="section">
  <p>Three fights are modified:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The battle with Karoug. Karoug himself is left alone, but Daese lives
      up to the villagers' warning about the wolfweres' magical powers. She becomes
      an eighth-level mage.</li>
    <li>The confrontation with Kaishas. Kaishas becomes a greater werewolf, with
      Free Action and immunity to all weapons except cold iron. (This seems to
      have been intended in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> but not properly implemented). She will also
      call for help from the tunnels: reinforcements will arrive at a rate of
      about one werewolf per round.</li>
    <li>The final battle with Selaad. Selaad and Baresh are now both greater
      werewolves, as well as being respectable opponents in human form - Baresh
      is a twelfth-level fighter, Selaad is a tenth-level mage. Only once reduced
      to below 25% hit points will they take on their wolfman forms.</li>
  </ul>
  <p> In addition, it is now possible to talk your way past Kaishas and on to
    the boat. Your protagonist needs either Intelligence 14+, or Wisdom 14+ and
    good alignment, and you need to have saved Maralee's baby and befriended
    Durlyle or Delainy. (This was an aspect of the original game that's always
    infuriated me - I <em>liked</em> Kaishas.) </p>

<h2>Overview</h2> 
<div class="section"> 
  <p>This mod expands on the depth of character and levels of interaction with
    the <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> from the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> game.
    When <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> was released, one of
    the major improvements in many peoples' eyes was the increased level of interaction
    one could have with the party members. This mod was developed to allow <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> players
    a similar experience. <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> in
    your party now have banters with the <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym>,
    with each other, and small side-quests of their own. As we were unable to
    get the original character voice actors to voice all the new lines, we instead
    sought out music appropriate to each <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> to
    be played whenever they initiate banter. This musical package is a separate,
    optional package (to keep the download size down), and you can find it on
    The Gibberlings Three download page.</p> 
</div> 
<h2>Compatibility</h2> 
<div class="section"> 
  <p>This mod is designed to work on Tutu v4, EasyTutu, and <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym>,
    all based on full, patched installs of Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate II.
    Neither the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> expansion Throne
    of Bhaal nor the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> expansion Tales
    of the Sword Coast are required. </p> 
  <p>This mod will not install correctly under versions of <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> below
    v204. This distribution ships with a <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> v204
    installer, which will automatically update your <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> installer
    version when you install The <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Project. </p> 
  <p><acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> v15
    is not currently compatible with Tutu v6. It might install, but is guaranteed
    to behave incorrectly. Don't say we didn't warn you.</p> 
  <p>Sword Coast Stratagems, EasyTutu, <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym>, <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>,
    and <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> Unfinished Business) have
    made special efforts to make sure players can use these mods together without
    conflict. In addition, we have adapted our code to allow concurrent use of
    Sirene's Call on both Tutu and <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym>.
    Please visit the forums for more information, especially on install order.</p>

    in <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=8122&amp;hl=">The
    Tutu State of the Modding Union</a> at the Gibberlings Three. </p>

    be sent to an Inn, another location, or to wait for you when you dismiss

    version before installing <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>'s
    version. In the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> version,

  <p><strong>The <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Project:

    in <a href="http://www.dudleyville.com/bg1/ar4000.htm">Gullykin</a> at the
    door to the winery. Change to the join-in dialogue: If you are using a mod
    which changes Alora's pre-joining dialogue significantly (no known mods do
    at the present), please be advised that we create an entirely new joining
    dialogue file.</p> 
  <p><strong>The <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Project:

    </strong><strong>Eldoth </strong>will start either at his regular location
    or at the <a href="http://www.dudleyville.com/bg1/ar2800b.htm">Coastal Way</a> by
    the obelisk. No change to the join-in dialogue.</p>

    </strong><strong>Quayle</strong> will be available in either his regular
    starting location or the <a href="http://www.dudleyville.com/bg1/ar4900.htm">Nashkel
    Carnival</a> near Great Gazib. No change to the join-in dialogue.</p> 
  <p><strong>The <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Project:

    in Feldepost's Inn. No change to the join-in dialogue.</p> 
  <p><strong>Jason Compton's Accelerated Banter Script<br /> 
    </strong>This component installs Jason Compton's Accelerated Banter Script,
    which basically makes banters happen more often. It is the same one as included
    with mods such as the Banter Packs for <acronym title="Baldur's Game II">BG2</acronym>,
    so if you have installed it there you don't need it again. Don't worry, the
    installer will tell you if you already have it installed.</p> 
  <p><strong>The <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Project:

    </strong><em>Tutu Only</em><br /> 
    This component installs a short set of changes to Shar-Teel and her scripts
    which make her unkillable until she joins the party. This allows both Tutu
    and <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym> players to have
    the duel necessary for Shar-Teel to join the party without risking her destruction.
    It is compatible with Sword Coast Stratagems' similar component. </p> 
  <p><strong>The <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Project:
      Bardic Reputation Adjustment<br /> 
    </strong>This component places three Bards in three inns scattered on the
    Sword Coast. Each can be hired to spread your fearsome reputation around,
    decreasing your reputation. The amount of money this costs is dependent on
    your current reputation. This allows players to manipulate reputation both
    upwards through temple donations, and downwards through the spread of rumors
    (for those of us who hate killing an innocent just to keep neutral <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> happy).</p> 
  <p><strong>The <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Project:
      Cloakwood areas availability in Chapter One<br /> 
    </strong>This component provides the option of opening up the first map of
    Cloakwood or all four Cloakwood maps at the start of the game. This is to
    support players who wish to pick up Coran and Faldorn earlier.</p>

    </strong>This component installs either SixofSpades' Expanded Sarevok Diary,
    or the original <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Project
    version which merely changes the dates to fit the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> storyline
    more closely. It also sets each as a book instead of a scroll. Not installing
    either means that you have the original diary, flagged as a scroll, with
    no content changes.</p> 
  <p><strong>The <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Project:
      Check for TutuFix Walking Speeds<br /> 
    </strong><em>Tutu Only</em><strong><br /> 
    </strong>This component can be used to match <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>-created
    actors/<acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> walking speeds
    to the default walking speeds if you have chosen to install TutuFix's Walking
    Speeds Component. It checks to see if Walking Speeds has modified the <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Montaron,
    and then checks each <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>-added
    creature you have installed to see if they qualify for the walking speed
    modification. If you have, it patches accordingly. If you have not installed
    TutuFix's Walking Speeds Component, no changes will be made. PLEASE NOTE:
    This component only checks <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> creatures.
    If you have added other mods, a better approach is to install the Walking
    Speeds component of TutuFix after all mods that add new quests, characters,
    or <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> have been applied.</p> 
  <p> <strong>WARNING: Tutufix's Walking Speeds component has odd effects on
      the Polymorph, Haste, and Slow spells.</strong> Fixes for these odd behaviors
      are under development by the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> Tweaks
      team at <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/">www.gibberlings3.net</a>.</p> 
  <p><strong>The <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Project:
      Player-Initiated Dialogues<br /> 
    </strong>This component will give the player force-talk options for all party
    members. This will allow the <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym> to
    ask questions about an <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> and
    their past. It also has a Player-initiated string-fixer for all <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym>.
    If an <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> is starting to
    say other character's lines, or sounds odd, then speak to the character and
    let them know that their voice "sounds strange". The <acronym title="Player-Initiated Dialogues">PID</acronym> string-fixer
    will re-map the voiced lines and responses for the character, allowing you
    to continue the game. To activate the <acronym title="Player-Initiated Dialogues">PIDs</acronym> or
    string-fixer, have your character talk to the <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> in
    question. Please note: the <acronym title="Player-Initiated Dialogues">PID</acronym> must
    be installed after all other <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> components.
    If you change an installation component involving dialogue, this component
    will automatically be uninstalled, and you may have to manually re-install
    it. </p>

<h2>MODDER'S NOTES</h2> 
<div class="section"> 
  <p> The philosophy driving coding in this project is to preserve compatibility
    with as wide a range of platforms and mods as possible. The <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Project
    v15 incorporates the following required core fixes to support Project code:</p> 
  <ul> 
    <li><a href="bg1npc_docs/BG1NPCVarIndex.htm">Index of Variables used in The <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Project

      coding of joinable NPCs who stack <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> dialogue
      on top of <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> dialogue. This
      will be most useful when used in conjunction with versions of <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym> v1.06
      and above.</li> 
    <li>non-destructive .tp2 patching of the pdialog.2da to incorporate Dream

    <li>non-destructive patching of several <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> to
      recheck that platform default override scripts and gnome animations are
      correct, and to force any .cre we use to effect v2 rather than v1 </li> 
    <li>Inclusion of STATE.IDS patching to support CD_STATE_NOTVALID (courtesy
      of CamDawg)</li> 
    <li>ACTION.IDS, TRIGGER.IDS, GTIMES.IDS, and ANIMATE.IDS updated to Throne

    <li>Inclusion of a patching macro to convert Tutu items to <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> items
      for <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym> compatibility </li> 
    <li>Patching in all Tutu v4 Area Script name assignments for existing areas.</li> 
    <li>Area Type (FOREST, OUTDOOR, etc.) flagging patch for all areas </li> 
    <li>Tutu only: WizWom's <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Battle
      fix, patching existing .bcs with REPLACE_TEXTUALLY ~MakeUnselectable(5000)~
      ~MakeUnselectable(6) Continue()~ </li> 
    <li>Miscellaneous non-destructive creature patching for all gnomes in the
      game, for animation, level, kit, etc.</li> 
    <li>In .DLG: Use of I_C_T with passback or I_C_T3 with passback for maximum
      compatibility with multiple interjections into the same state. </li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>This list covers the required components. For compatibility notes on individually
    installed components, please evaluate the code directly, remembering that
    the files are often interlinked - so search carefully. While almost all Project
    code actively tries to avoid compatibility problems, two specific components
    do readjust major expected behaviors. ALORA being moved destructively overwrites
    a new pre-joining [_]ALORA.DLG, so if a mod has added to her pre-joined file
    those materials will be destroyed. KAGAIN's Caravan Quest shuts the variable "KagainCaravan" off
    and replaces it with a new expanded quest using "X#KagainCaravan". </p> 
  <p> As of March, 2008, none of the above items have shown incompatibility problems
    in testing with both Tutu and <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym> standard
    mods installed in the recommended orders from the forums.</p>

    <li>Repairs to Jaheira commenting on Gorion before burial looping</li> 
    <li>Altered scripting for Gorion's Burial as it could cause future issues </li> 
    <li>WizWom's <acronym title="Non-PLayer Character">NPC</acronym> Fight Fix
      tested, works great with Tutu; confirmed incompatable with <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym> side</li> 
    <li>Created new optional component "Make Shar-Teel Unkillable"</li> 
    <li><acronym title="Death Variable">DV</acronym> repairs to Jaheira's Quest
      creatures</li> 
    <li>Repairs to Ajantis' <acronym title="Tales of the Sword Coast">TotSC</acronym>/Non-<acronym title="Tales of the Sword Coast">TotSC</acronym> compiled
      romance dialogues</li> 
    <li>Big Group Project Completed: all TRA files fully proofread and integrated;
      multiple repairs</li> 
    <li>Repaired Eldoth/Bentley Store label </li> 
    <li>Fixed and expanded various script triggers and identifiers by "lifting" libraries

      Cutscene names/objects for Xan's minor quest, tp2 id of Bag of Grain</li>

      amounts of rewriting, testing, and adapting to get the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym> side
      to be part of the single install. Still at Beta status for <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym>,
      as we are occasionally running into <acronym title="Player-Initiated Dialogues">PID</acronym> conflicts
      with dialogues; the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym> side
      seems to have restored almost all of these always-true timered conditions,
      so I have to go fix them one by one. It installs, works better than the
      previous ones, and has taught me a lot, but still is definitely a Beta.
      Biggest single change from Beta 2 was the moving of a number of .cre and
      item creations to use existing creature files as templates, and the addition
      of a <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym>-to-Tutu item
      macro </li>

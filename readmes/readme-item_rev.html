<h2>Notes</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>Before installing <acronym title="Item Revisions">IR</acronym>, be sure to apply the latest hotfixes. They can be found <a href="http://gibberlings3.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=15698">here</a>, and should fix most problems reported in the current version of the mod.</p>
</div>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>Item Revisions aims to fix/tweak/enhance all items in Baldur's Gate II. Weaker items have been improved, overpowered ones have been (or will be) nerfed, many descriptions have been extended or replaced with more appropriate ones, and so on. In addition, there are a number of rule changes available that can be chosen individually as the user wishes.</p>
</div>
<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>
    This mod has been designed to work with <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>: Throne of Bhaal, and the main component requires it be installed. The mod has been tested and may be used with <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym>. The main component will not affect Tutu items at this time, but support is planned. Most other components should be fine on Tutu. Item Revisions should work well with most other <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> and non-<acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> mods if proper install order is followed.
    <br /><br />The main component of the mod overwrites existing items and descriptions, and should be installed prior to mods that patch those items. In the case where you'd prefer a file not be altered by <acronym title="Item Revisions">IR</acronym>, you have the option of disabling the specific item modification prior to installing the mod. Details on how to do so can be found in the Installation section below.
    <br /><br />The other components of the mod have been designed to patch all items, and should be installed after all mods that add or replace items. Ideally, these components should be installed just after other tweak mods (near the very end of the install). Note that it is possible to install the main component only, exit the installer, install more mods, and then re-start the installer and install other components.
    <br /><br />Items in <acronym title="Item Revisions">IR</acronym>'s main component come with their own descriptions, and a number of the optional components adjust description information by patching. It's important to note that there are a few tweak mods out there which completely overwrite existing item descriptions based on the assumption that they previously looked as they do in the vanilla game. If you are installing Item Revisions' main component, we recommend avoiding these mod components completely.
    <br /><br /><strong>Mod Components Known to Overwrite Descriptions:</strong>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ashes of Embers -> Sensible weapon restrictions for SoA (non-mod weapons) <sup></sup></li>
    <li>Ashes of Embers -> Sensible weapon restrictions for ToB (non-mod weapons) <sup></sup></li>
    <li>Ashes of Embers -> Sensible weapon restrictions for BG1Tutu <sup></sup></li>
    <li>Ashes of Embers -> Throwing Spears <sup></sup></li>
    <li>Unfinished Business -> Extended ToB Item Descriptions <sup>[1]</sup></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <sup>[1]</sup> Already included in IR's main component.
    <br /><br /><br /><em>The following information applies only to those installing Item Revisions' main component.</em>
    <br /><br />The Visual Ioun Stones component from Ding0's Tweak Pack (d0tweak) should not be installed alongside <acronym title="Item Revisions">IR</acronym>'s main component because we've included WoRm's pretty ioun stone animations. Thanks, WoRm!
    <br /><br />Regarding <acronym title="One Pixel Productions">1PP</acronym>: Erephine has kindly granted permission to use some of her artwork in our mod (including flaming swords!), and many items have been recoloured to look better and match their new lore.
    <br /><br /><strong><acronym title="One Pixel Productions">1PP</acronym> Components Included:</strong>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>V2 -> Everything but Potions (please don't try to install this after <acronym title="Item Revisions">IR</acronym>... bad things will happen)</li>
    <li>V3 Paperdolls</li>
    <li>Flaming Swords</li>
    <li>Legacy <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym> Buckler, Small Shield, and Medium Shield Animations</li>
    <li>Helmets</li>
    <li>Shields</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong><acronym title="One Pixel Productions">1PP</acronym> Components Not Included:</strong></p>

  </ul>
</div>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p><strong>Windows</strong>
    <br />Item Revisions is packaged and installed with <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> and is distributed as a self-extracting archive. To install, simply double-click the archive and follow the instructions on screen. This method is not recommended when you wish to apply hotfixes, unless you quit from the WeiDU installer when it appears.
  </p>
  <p>Alternatively the files can be extracted from the archive using <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/">WinRAR</a>. If properly extracted, you should have an item_rev folder and setup-item_rev.exe in your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder. Any hotfixes should be applied at this point. To install, simply double-click setup-item_rev.exe and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
  <p>Please run <strong>setup-item_rev.exe</strong> in your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
  <p><strong>Mac OS X</strong>
    <br /><em>If the mod was previously installed, uninstall it before extracting the new version.</em> Item Revisions is packaged and installed with <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>. To install, simply extract the contents of the mod into your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder. If properly extracted, you should have an item_rev folder, setup-item_rev, and setup-item_rev.command in your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder. Any hotfixes should be applied at this point. To install, simply double-click <strong>setup-item_rev.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Linux</strong>
    <br />Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify. Any hotfixes should be applied at this point. Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="http://www.weidu.org/~thebigg "><acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>.org</a> and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal and cd to your BG2 installation directory, run 'tolower' and answer Y to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only this mod since the last time you lower cased file name. If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.
    <br /><br />Run <strong>WeInstall item_rev</strong> in your game folder to install the mod. Then run <strong>wine BGMain.exe</strong> and start playing.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p><strong>How to Prevent Certain Items from Being Installed</strong>
    <br />Note: this must be done before installing the mod. To disable a certain item, open the file <strong>item_rev/components/main_component.tpa</strong> with a text editor, search for the item in question and comment it out /* like so */. Anything inside the commented area will get skipped when installing. Here is an example for Carsomyr.
    <br /><br />main_component.tpa - searching for 'Carsomyr' yields:
    <br /><em>// Carsomyr +4
    <br />COPY ~item_rev\itm\sw2h10.itm~      ~override\sw2h10.itm~
    <br />SAY NAME1 @1760
    <br />SAY NAME2 @2199
    <br />SAY UNIDENTIFIED_DESC @1762
    <br />SAY DESC @2200</em>
    <br /><br />Adding the following will prevent the item from being installed:
    <br /><em>// Carsomyr +4
    <br /><span class="red">/* </span>COPY ~item_rev\itm\sw2h10.itm~      ~override\sw2h10.itm~
    <br />SAY NAME1 @1760
    <br />SAY NAME2 @2199
    <br />SAY UNIDENTIFIED_DESC @1762
    <br />SAY DESC @2200<span class="red"> */</span></em>
    <br /><br />Congratulations, Carsomyr +4 will no longer be changed when you install the mod! But wait, doesn't Carsomyr have an upgrade in <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym>? To prevent that from being installed, you'd need to keep searching for Carsomyr and comment out the +5 version when you find it, too. If you have any questions or require assistance with any of the above, feel free to drop us a line in the <a href="http://gibberlings3.net/forums/index.php?showforum=157">forum</a>.

<h2>Contents</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>The changes made by Item Revisions fall into two categories - individual and global. The main component of the mod will install all of the individual changes, like adding new abilities and lore to existing items. The other components of the mod are designed to provide rule changes to all items in the game, including those added by other mods.</p>
  <h3>Main Component</h3>
  <p><strong>Item Revisions by Demivrgvs</strong>
    <br /><em>Any modifications made to items prior to installing this component will be overwritten.</em>
    <br /><br />This component contains all of the changes made to specific items. Full item descriptions are available in item_rev/languages/english/item_descriptions.tra and an overview is provided on the forums. Listed below are some of the philosophical changes.
    <br /><strong>These items have been designed in tandem with the optional components, and may not be balanced without certain components installed. Components that are deemed recommended for balance when installing the main component will carry a red asterisk (<span class="red">*</span>). A blue asterisk (<span class="blue">*</span>) will be used in cases where a component has multiple recommended options.</strong>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li class="spaced_item"><strong>Characteristics Set by Items</strong>
      <br />Items that previously set character attributes to X now increase the base value by Y. This change is aimed to remove some exploits (like having characters with 3 charisma suddenly becoming more charismatic than Obama just by equipping a standard magic item), and to make characters' starting attributes more important.
      <br /><br />
      <ul>
        <li>Items that previously set characteristics to 18 or 19 will now grant +2 instead, 20 to 21 are now +3, 22 to 23 are +4, and 24 to 25 become +5. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li class="spaced_item"><strong>Sensible Prices</strong>
      <br />I found the prices of items in vanilla <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> to often be quite random, and I wanted to tie them to the actual value of the item. I've used the following table as a guideline to standardize item prices, adjusting it a little when needed.
      <br />
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th class="leftalign">Total Enchantment Bonus</th>
          <th>Price</th>
          <th>Notes</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="leftalign">Unenchanted</td>
          <td>As Per <acronym title="Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons">AD&amp;D</acronym> 2nd Edition Player's Handbook</td>
          <td>&nbsp;
        </td></tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="leftalign">Masterwork</td>
          <td>500gp</td>
          <td>Daggers: Only 250gp</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="leftalign">+1</td>
          <td>1000gp</td>
          <td>Regular Full Plate Is Treated as +1 Quality</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="leftalign">+2</td>
          <td>3000gp</td>
          <td>&nbsp;</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="leftalign">+3</td>
          <td>5000gp</td>
          <td>Stonefire as a +2 Axe with the Flaming Property Is Treated as +3 Quality</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="leftalign">+4</td>
          <td>7500gp</td>
          <td>&nbsp;</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="leftalign">+5</td>
          <td>10000gp</td>
          <td>And So On...</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Even the most powerful <acronym title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</acronym> items shouldn't have a total enchantment bonus greater than +5 or +6, except in rare cases.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li class="spaced_item"><strong>Effect of Charisma and Reputation on Store Prices</strong>
      <br />Reputation will no longer provide any discount (most stores shouldn't even know charname's reputation, and it doesn't make sense that neutral or evil parties are so heavily penalized). Charisma will still give a small discount.
      <br /><br />
      <ul>
        <li>
          <acronym title="Charisma">CHR</acronym> 15/16 (-5%), <acronym title="Charisma">CHR</acronym> 17/18 (-10%), <acronym title="Charisma">CHR</acronym> 19/20 (-15%), <acronym title="Charisma">CHR</acronym> 21/22 (-20%), <acronym title="Charisma">CHR</acronym> 23/24 (-25%), <acronym title="Charisma">CHR</acronym> 25 (-30%).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li class="spaced_item"><strong>Sensible Lore System</strong>
      <br />In my opinion, the lore system in the vanilla game was broken, having random lore values and allowing a level 10 bard to identify just about everything. I've changed both the lore table and the required lore to identify every item. The effect of intelligence and wisdom on lore is unchanged.
      <br /><br />
      <ul>
        <li>Lore Table: Fighters/Paladins/Rangers (+1 lore/level), Clerics/Druids (+2 lore/level), Thieves/Blades (+3 lore/level), Mages (+4 lore/level), Bards (+6 lore/level). </li>
        <li>Lore Required to Identify: Every item will require 10 lore per enchantment bonus, plus an additional 5, 10, or 15, depending on whether the item is common, rare, or unique. For example, Arrows +1 have a +1 bonus and are quite common, thus they will require 15 lore to be identified. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li class="spaced_item"><strong>Item Restriction Changes</strong>
      <br /><br />
      <ul>
        <li>Druids Shouldn't Wear Metal: Druids can no longer use helmets, and Fighter/Druids cannot wear helmets or metal armor.</li>
        <li>Kensais Can Use Bracers: Kensais now have access to bracers, but not gauntlets.</li>
        <li>Thieves Can Use Wands: But they will need to meet an <acronym title="Intelligence">INT</acronym> requirement between 10 and 17, depending on the power of the wand.
      </li></ul>
    </li>
    <li class="spaced_item"><strong>Weapon Changes</strong>
      <br />These changes started as a way to make bastard swords more appealing, and evolved into adjusting a number of weapon types so as to make every class of weapon appealing.
      <br /><br />
      <ul>
        <li>All Bows: Now cause additional damage equal to enchantment level, but provide only an extra half attack per round instead of an extra full attack. Composite bows now deal 2 damage more than regular bows, instead of 1 damage more.</li>
        <li>Long Bows: Replaced +1 <acronym title="To Hit Armor Class 0">THAC0</acronym> bonus with +1 damage bonus.</li>
        <li>Crossbows: Now grant +1 <acronym title="To Hit Armor Class 0">THAC0</acronym>.</li>
        <li>Bolts: Now cause additional damage equal to enchantment level.</li>
        <li>Two-Handed Swords: Base damage changed from 1d10 to 2d6.</li>
        <li>Bastard Swords: Base damage changed from 2d4 to 1d10.</li>
        <li>Spears: Base damage changed from 1d6 to 1d8.</li>
        <li>War Hammers: Base damage changed from 1d4+1 to 1d8. Base speed changed from 5 to 7.</li>
        <li>Flails: Base damage changed from 1d6+1 to 1d10. Base speed changed from 7 to 9.</li>
        <li>Wakizashis: Proficiency changed from Scimitar/Wakizashi/Ninja-To to Katana/Wakizashi.</li>
        <li>Ninja-Tos: Proficiency changed from Scimitar/Wakizashi/Ninja-To to Short Sword/Ninja-To.</li>
        <li>Morning Stars: Proficiency changed from Flail/Morning Star to Mace/Morning Star. Base speed changed from 7 to 8.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Masterwork Weapons</strong>
    <br />Previously a mandatory part of the main component, this has been made optional due to player request. This component will replace many of the normal +1 weapons found in the game with masterwork versions. Masterwork weapons gain the +1 <acronym title="To Hit Armor Class 0">THAC0</acronym> bonus of +1 weapons, but not the +1 to damage, and are not effective against creatures only affected by magical weapons. This component may be installed at any time, though it is recommended to pair it with the main component.
  </p>
  <h3>Global Changes </h3>
  <p>These components are designed to affect all items in game, and should be installed after other mods that add items.</p>
  <p><strong>Spellcasting in Armor with a Chance of Arcane Casting Failure (Option 1) (<span class="blue">*</span>)</strong>
    <br />This component allows those arcane spellcasters who can equip armor (namely multiclass mages) to be able to cast spells in them, albeit with a chance of failing miserably. The following table elaborates on the penalties.
    <br /><br /><em>Note: This is one of the components that relies on a user-submitted list to categorize shields and armors into their proper type. If you find an item that appears unaffected by this change, or miscategorized, please submit a report <a href="http://gibberlings3.net/forums/index.php?showforum=157">here</a> and include whether you have installed the main <acronym title="Item Revisions">IR</acronym> component or not.</em>

    </tr>
  </table>
  <p><strong>Spellcasting in Armor with Casting Speed Penalties for Arcane Casters (Option 2) (<span class="blue">*</span>)</strong>
    <br />This component allows those arcane spellcasters who can equip armor (namely multiclass mages) to be able to cast spells in them, albeit at a slower rate than normal. To give a little overview, a spellcaster can cast only 1 spell per round (in most circumstances), but those spells have a casting time that denotes how much of the round it takes between starting to cast the spell and witnessing its effect. The default spells usually have a casting time between 1 and 10. 10 is a full round, while 1 is near-instantaneous. This component will increase the casting time of all spells while equipping armor and shields by the values indicated in the table below. <strong>Due to implementation limitations, this component causes cleric/mages and fighter/mage/clerics to suffer slower casting speed on both their divine and arcane spells. Other divine casters are unaffected.</strong> Feedback on balancing this component would be appreciated.
    <br /><br /><em>Note: This is one of the components that relies on a user-submitted list to categorize shields and armors into their proper type. If you find an item that appears unaffected by this change, or miscategorized, please submit a report <a href="http://gibberlings3.net/forums/index.php?showforum=157">here</a> and include whether you have installed the main <acronym title="Item Revisions">IR</acronym> component or not.</em>

  <p><strong>Spellcasting in Armor with Casting Speed Penalties for All Casters (Option 3)</strong>
    <br />This component allows those arcane spellcasters who can equip armor (namely multiclass mages) to be able to cast spells in them, albeit at a slower rate than normal. In addition, it causes divine casters to suffer the same casting speed penalties as their arcane brethren while equipping armor and shields. To give a little overview, a spellcaster can cast only 1 spell per round (in most circumstances), but those spells have a casting time that denotes how much of the round it takes between starting to cast the spell and witnessing its effect. The default spells usually have a casting time between 1 and 10. 10 is a full round, while 1 is near-instantaneous. This component will increase the casting time of all spells while equipping armor and shields by the values indicated in the table above. Feedback on balancing this component would be appreciated.

  <p><strong>Backstabbing Penalties for Inappropriate Weapons (Option 1) (<span class="blue">*</span>)</strong>
    <br /><em>This component is conceptually incompatible with the Improved Backstabbing component from Ding0's Tweak Pack (d0tweak).</em>
    <br /><br />This component applies a penalty to backstabbing with certain weapon types as listed below. It does not enable backstabbing with weapons that single-class thieves cannot normally use - everything on the table at a -2 or worse modifier with the exception of quarterstaffs will remain unsuitable for backstabbing. This component was inspired by the similar component in Ding0's Tweak Pack. <strong>This component also modifies flaming swords to apply a -50% penalty to Hide in Shadows while equipped.</strong>

  <p><strong>Backstabbing Penalties for Inappropriate Weapons with More Weapons Usable for Backstabbing (Option 2) (<span class="blue">*</span>)</strong>
    <br /><em>This component is conceptually incompatible with the Improved Backstabbing component from Ding0's Tweak Pack (d0tweak).</em>
    <br /><br />This component applies a penalty to backstabbing with certain weapon types as listed above. It also enables the use of backstabbing with items traditionally unsuitable for backstabbing. The reason this component is available separately from Option 1 is because suitability for backstabbing depends on the item being usable by single-class thieves. In other words, this component will make all melee weapons usable by multi-class thieves also usable by single-class thieves. They will remain unable to put proficiency points into these weapon categories, however. This option was inspired by the similar one in Level 1 NPCs. <strong>This component also modifies flaming swords to apply a -50% penalty to Hide in Shadows while equipped.</strong>

<h2>Shout Outs</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p><strong>Demi:</strong> Firstly, many thanks to Gibberlings Three, especially Cam, and cmorgan!
    <br /><br />Huge thanks of course to Westley Weimer, who created an astonishingly flexible and powerful mod editor for <acronym title="Infinity Engine">IE</acronym> games, and to the bigg for his modifications to that editor. Many thanks also to the creators of the Infinity Engine Structure Description Project, which clarified what the hell was going on several dozen times; and to Jon Hauglid, for Near Infinity.
    <br /><br />Special thanks to Erephine for creating and letting me use that wonderful <acronym title="One Pixel Productions">1PP</acronym> material!
    <br /><br />I'm also very grateful to anyone who has beta-tested the mod and/or provided much useful feedback.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p><strong>Mike:</strong> I'd like to give a big thanks to the authors of the many tools used in creation of this mod - we (literally) couldn't have done it without you. The mod community as a whole also deserves special mention - I find the vast majority of those with an interest in the creation and playing of <acronym title="Infinity Engine">IE</acronym> mods are extremely supportive of one another, and knowing that your work will provide enjoyment to others is a great motivator. Finally, I'd like to thank those individuals at <acronym title="The Gibberlings 3">G3</acronym> who set me along the path to modding in the first place, everyone who has expressed interest in the creation of this mod, and <acronym title="The Gibberlings 3">G3</acronym> in general for hosting this here.</p>
  <br />
  <p>The <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg2tweaks/index.php"><acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> Tweak Pack</a> was a major inspiration and help while coding this mod, and some code has been directly pillaged from it.

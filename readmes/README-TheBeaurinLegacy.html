  <p><strong> Version 3.0 </strong><br /> 
    <strong> Languages:</strong> English<br /> 
    <strong> Platforms: </strong>Windows, Mac OS X, Linux</p> 
</div> 
<h2>Overview</h2> 
<div class="section"> 
  <p>The Beaurin Legacy introduces an elven Enchanter/Thief and a hidden NPC to BGII:SoA, ToB, and BGII:EE. Minyae Beaurin can be found outside of the Crooked Crane in the City Gates. The mod includes custom portraits, friendship tracks, numerous banters and interjections, new items, encounters and quest(s), voicing for both NPCs (However, Minyae is fully voiced), a romance with a Bioware NPC, player-initiated dialogues, and custom friendship track themes.</p> 
</div> 
<h2>Compatibility</h2> 
<div class="section"> 
  <p>This mod is designed to work with Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition and the original Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn and Throne of Bhaal by Bioware.</p> 
  <p>The mod should be compatible with other WeiDU mods.</p> 
</div> 
<h2>Installation</h2> 
<div class="section"> 
  <p><strong>Windows</strong><br /> 
    The Beaurin Legacy is packaged and installed with <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> and
    is distributed as a self-extracting archive. To install, simply double-click
    the archive and follow the instructions on screen. </p> 
  <p>Alternatively the files can be extracted from the archive using <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/">WinRAR</a>.
    If properly extracted, you should have a TheBeaurinLegacy folder and Setup-TheBeaurinLegacy.exe
    in your Tutu folder. To install, simply double-click Setup-TheBeaurinLegacy.exe and
    follow the instructions on screen. </p> 
  <p>Please run Setup-TheBeaurinLegacy.exe in your Tutu folder to reinstall, uninstall or
    otherwise change components. </p> 
  <p><strong>Mac OS X</strong><br /> 
    <em>If the mod was previously installed, uninstall it before extracting the
    new version.</em> The Beaurin Legacy is packaged and installed with <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>.
    To install, simply extract the contents of the mod into your Tutu folder.
    If properly extracted, you should have a TheBeaurinLegacy folder, Setup-TheBeaurinLegacy, and Setup-TheBeaurinLegacy.command
    in your <acronym>Tutu</acronym> folder. To install, simply double-click <strong>Setup-TheBeaurinLegacy.command</strong> and
    follow the instructions on screen.</p> 
	<strong>Linux</strong><br />
Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify. Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="http://www.weidu.org/~thebigg "><acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>.org</a> and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal, cd to your BG2 installation directory, run 'tolower' and answer Y to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only this mod since the last time you lower cased file name. If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.<br />
Run <strong>WeInstall TheBeaurinLegacy</strong> in your game folder to install the mod. Then run <strong>wine BGMain.exe</strong> and start playing.</p>
</div>

<h2>Contents</h2> 
<div class="section"> 
  <p>This modification adds Minyae, a Neutral Evil Elf Enchanter/Mage, to the game. Her statistics are as follows:</p> 
  <ul> 
    <li><acronym title="Strength">STR</acronym>: 12</li> 
    <li><acronym title="Dexterity">DEX</acronym>: 19</li> 
    <li><acronym title="Constitution">CON</acronym>: 11</li> 
    <li><acronym title="Intelligence">INT</acronym>: 17</li> 
    <li><acronym title="Wisdom">WIS</acronym>: 12</li> 
    <li><acronym title="Charisma">CHR</acronym>: 16</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>Unlike most thieves and mages, she specializes in daggers and two weapon style. She also has a proficiency in darts.</p> 
  <p>Minyae includes a "friendship track" that continues through Throne of Bhaal, banters with all Bioware NPCs (including the Beamdog's four NPCs and a romance path for a certain Red Wizard), numerous interjections and extensive player-initiated dialogue.</p> 
  <p>In Throne of Bhaal, the hidden NPC also includes a "friendship track", banters with all Bioware NPCs, interjections, and extensive player-initiated dialogue.</p> 
 

</div>
<h2>Player-initiated Dialogue</h2> 
<div class="section"> 
  <p> The player can talk to Minyae or the Hidden NPC directly at any time in the game, no matter if the PC is on the friendship path or not. However, there is one specific friendship talk that must be initiated through the player-initiated dialogues to continue her friendship path in SoA. This dialogue will not be immediately available, you must wait approximately 45 minutes in real-time to initiate the talk.

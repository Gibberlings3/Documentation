<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>This mod adds a joinable <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> for
    Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn. Amber is a tiefling rogue of a chaotic
    good alignment, possessed of a few special abilities. Despite being fairly
    intelligent, she can at times be rather blunt when communicating with other
    people. This trait rarely earns her friends among the people she meets, and
    the feeling of initial dislike is usually mutual. But underneath her prickly
    manners, she has a good heart and is prepared to go to great lengths to help
    those who she sees to be weak and in need of aid.</p>
  <p>The mod features not only romance and friendship tracks for the protagonist,
    but also a romance track for a second <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym> in
    a multiplayer game (Player 2). This feature is also exploitable in a single
    player game if you want enjoy two concurrent romances without cheating. For
    more information, check out the <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/index.php?showforum=69">discussion
    forum</a>. In addition, Amber is lavishly voiced and has her own original
    musical theme.</p>
  <p>The quest that leads to meeting Amber begins in the streets of Athkatla,
    and can take place before or after your journey to Brynnlaw.</p>
</div>

      of Amn portion currently includes two components, that are available both in English and German:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>1. Amber, a chaotic good tiefling fighter and thief (dual class)

        <li>original music that plays during the conversations with the <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym> (due

          slots in songlist.2da)</li>
        <li>custom made <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> script
          (courtesy of Yovaneth)</li>
        <li>up to 13 casual interactions with the player character including
          one in-between talk if you can't quite decide whether you want to be
          friends or something else</li>
        <li>up to 10 chapter-specific interactions with the player character</li>
        <li>up to 13 player-initiated conversation topics to discuss about if
          the casual interactions left you wanting more</li>
        <li>one of these three relationship paths:
          <ul>
            <li>a friendship path for the protagonist with
              <ul>
                <li>up to 9 friendly interactions</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>romance with a suitable male protagonist with
              <ul>
                <li>24 romantic interactions, of which 7 are 'floating' and 3
                  are kind of pick-up talks if things are about to go sour between
                  you and Amber</li>
                <li>a flirt pack with unique Amber-initiated flirts and an extensive
                  set of player-initiated flirts</li>
                <li>a romance conflict with Viconia, Jaheira and Aerie; Amber
                  will also react to Solaufein's romance</li>
                <li>the Bodhi abduction quest</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>a romance with another suitable male player character in a multiplayer
              game if the protagonist is not agreeable, with
              <ul>
                <li>customised friendly interactions and lovetalks to replace
                  those suitable only to the protagonist</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>2 or 3 regular banters with all BioWare <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> and
          a set of scripted banters with Imoen, Viconia and Haer'Dalis</li>
        <li>up to 47 interjections and reactions to conversations between the
          player character and non-party <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym>,
          plus additional 24 interjections with minor citizens of Amn</li>
        <li>Tree of Life with different options depending on your relationship
          with Amber</li>
        <li>special interjections, banters and more for the Underdark</li>
        <li>a string fixer (SHIFT-k) in case, for example, re-installation mixes
          up her soundset and name strings in old savegames</li>
        <li>3 mini-quests with copious dialogue, new areas (edited from original
          game areas) and voicing for six non-party <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym></li>
        <li>several brand new items, some more useful than others, along with
          an upgrade to the Blade of Roses</li>
        <li>small tweaks including
          <ul>
            <li>corrected spear animations: more stabbing and less swinging</li>
            <li>corrected Haer'Dalis' blades description texts: they're usable
              only by Haer'Dalis, not by all tieflings</li>
            <li>corrected kit.ids and added <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym> scripting
              functions</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>and a hilarious Easter Egg to boot! *Now includes singing and music!*</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>2. Multiplayer-friendly flirting for Amber</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Flirting with Amber will not pause the entire game. The other players
          are free to do their shopping, adjust inventories of their characters
          etc., and you can make out with your sweetheart without annoying your
          co-players. This is an optional component that will be of use mostly
          to multiplayers.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

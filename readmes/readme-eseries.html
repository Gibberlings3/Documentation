    <div class="ribbon_triangle_h2-l"></div>

<p> The eSeries is a collection of Party <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> Scripts      for Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn with or without the expansion Throne of Bhaal, Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition,. Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition, and the conversions Tutu, BGT, and EET.      Currently there are seven scripts included in the series: eArcher, eFighter,      eMage, eMulti, ePriest, ePureF, and eThief. As you should be able to tell      from the names of the scripts, they are tailored to specific character classes.      There is some overlap in abilities, but generally speaking, the scripts are      most potent when they are assigned to a character of the corresponding class.</p>
  <p> The eSeries sprang from the magnificent Player <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> Scripts      known as the gSeries, which was developed by Greg Hodgson (aka Sarkyn). The      gSeries was fully fleshed for doing battle in Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of      Amn but, unfortunately for those of us who loved the capabilties of the series,      Greg chose to exit the Baldur's Gate Scripting community prior to updating      the scripts with the scripting options available in the final chapter of      the Baldur's Gate Trilogy, The Throne of Bhaal. Considering the intrusions      of real life and all the other wonderful videogames available for capturing      our imaginations, I don't blame Greg in the slightest for finding other things      to fill up his time. Wherever he is, I hope that life is treating him well.      Cheers, Greg!</p>
  <p>So one day while playing Throne of Bhaal, I decided I just couldn't take      the gSeries' lack of <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym> support      any longer and although there were a couple of other high quality Player <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> Scripts      out there, Rich Martel's [uScript_2001-09-27] and Gebhard Blucher's [GB-Scripts]      for instance, my loyalty to the scripts that had performed so well in Shadows      of Amn superceded my interest in convenience and despite my relatively rudimentary      understanding of Infinity Engine <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> scripting,      I, with Greg's consent, jumped in and began to overhaul the gSeries to bring      it up to <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym> date.</p>

  <li>This mod is designed to work with Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn with or without the expansion Throne of Bhaal, Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition,. Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition, and the conversions Tutu, BGT, and EET</li>
  <li>eSeries includes the installation of Detectable Spells. As the package        doesn't seem to have a permanent information page, grab it directly off        the IEGMC mirrors: <a href="http://america.iegmc.net/bpdetectstat/">America</a> | <a href="http://iegmc.mirror.intermedia.com.sg/bpdetectstat/">Asia</a> | <a href="http://iegmc.shphockey.com/bpdetectstat/">Canada</a> | <a href="http://iegmc.tiefighter.org/bpdetectstat/">Europe</a></li>
  <li>eSeries has a small incompatibility with Refinement's Shapeshifting Fix:        druids will not automatically shapeshift with this component installed. </li>
  <li>The eSeries contains specific shout responses systems that allow the        individual scripts to coordinate effectively, therefore it is not advised        to mix the eseries with other Player <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> scripts. </li>

      <p><strong>Enhanced Editions Note</strong><br />
        The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every   patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a   modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as   even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with   your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a   new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. For BG2:EE it is important that you install the mod to the language   version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod   will not show but give error messages. </p>
      <p><strong>Windows</strong><br />
        eSeries for Windows is distributed as a self-extracting   archive and includes a WeiDU installer. To install, simply double-click   the archive and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, the files can be extracted into your game directory using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a> or <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-eseries.exe</strong> and the folder<strong> eseries</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-eseries.exe</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-eseries.exe</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>Mac OS X</strong><br />
        eSeries  for Mac OS X is distributed as a compressed tarball and includes a WeiDU installer.</p>
      <p>First, extract the files from the tarball into your game directory. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-eseries</strong>, <strong>setup-eseries.command</strong>, and the folder<strong> eseries</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-eseries.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-eseries.command</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>Linux</strong><br />
        eSeries  for Linux is distributed as a compressed tarball and does not include a WeiDU installer.</p>
      <p>Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.</p>
      <p>Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="http://www.weidu.org/%7Ethebigg/">WeiDU.org</a> and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal, cd to your game installation directory, run tolower   and answer Y to both queries. You can avoid running the second option   (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save   time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the   first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only   this mod since the last time you lowercased file names. If you're   unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.</p>
      <p>To install, run WeInstall eseries in your game folder. Then run wine BGMain.exe and start playing. </p>
      <p><strong> Note for Complete Uninstallation</strong><br />
        In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely uninstall the mod using setup-eseries --uninstall at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts. . </p>

You can visit <a href="http://gibberlings3.net/forums/">The      Gibberlings Three</a> for information on this and any other mods on which      we may be working.</p>

<p><strong>Version 3 - September 3, 2018</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Compatibility updates for EE</li>
        <li>Included DS in eSeries</li>
        <li>Streamlined code</li>
      </ul>
<p><strong>Version 2</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Removed setup.bat</li>
        <li>Updated to WeiDU v213</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version 1.8</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Added Azlaer's Harp, Potion of Firebreath</li>
        <li><acronym title="The Gibberlings Three's">G3's</acronym> Divine Remix        Spells - Strength of Stone, Pro from Good, Pro from Good 10', Conjure Air        Elemental, Battleguard of Tempus Tenser's Transformation</li>
        <li>Cleaning, Vacuuming, and Re-arranging courtesy of Horred the Plague</li>
        <li>Changed druid shapeshifting algorithim again. This time I'm using a random        number trigger. High level shapes have a 70% chance, medium level shapes        a 60% chance, and low level shapes 50% chance of occurring, if the other        triggers in the blocks return True.</li>
        <li>Added German translation and ReadMe courtesy of Leonardo Watson</li>
        <li>Added Spanish translation courtesy of Immortality</li>
        <li>Fixed some leftover <acronym title="Line of Sight">LOS</acronym> issues        from Horred's cleanup</li>
        <li><acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> v196</li>
        <li>Fixed issue where eSeries would fail to install after Kelsey or Ascension,        as they overwrite stats.ids completely </li>
        <li>Fixed issue where eSeries was appending the correctly spelled but unused        stat WIZARD_KHELBENS_WARDING_WHIP instead of the proper entry of WIZARD_KHELBANS_WARDING_WHIP.        This could cause compile errors if  Detectable Stats was not installed        or if the  Detectable Stats changes were overwritten by another mod prior        to eSeries (i.e. Kelsey or Ascension) </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version 1.7 (not released)</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Internal test build, not released </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version 1.6 (not released)</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Internal testing build, not released </li>
        <li>Druid shapeshift algorithim changed to 4 <acronym title="Armor Class">AC</acronym> points        less that the effective <acronym title="Armor Class">AC</acronym> of the        creature that the druid polymorphs into</li>
        <li>Added OR !HaveAnySpells() check to the <acronym title="Armor Class">AC</acronym> check,        so if you out of spells you should transform and attack. Shapeshifting        is a druid class feature, it should get used at least some.</li>
        <li>Re-added gs_GoodBerries.baf to eMulti because SimDing0 has made the spell        reasonably useful again. Thanks SimDing0</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version 1.5</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Added OS X installer</li>
        <li>Moved to The Gibberlings Three </li>
        <li>Scripts now compiled on-the-fly </li>
      </ul>
      <p> <strong>Version 1.4</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Removed Simulacrum <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> Change        while I work on a better method for assigning scripts to clones</li>
        <li>Removed Breach Shield Check because it used Change Specifics which could        potentially break some areas of the game - Suggestion by SimDing0</li>
        <li>Comment out ChangeSpecifics actions in gs_AntiMage_TL4</li>
        <li>Switched to using PUPPETTYPE and PUPPETMASTERTYPE to determine allowance/preventation        of casting clone spells</li>
        <li>Noted incompatability between <acronym title="Pen and Paper">PnP</acronym> Celestials        and the eSeries, if <acronym title="Pen and Paper">PnP</acronym> Celestials        is installed after the eSeries. Caedwyr has been notified and indicated        that the incompatability will be removed in a future version of <acronym title="Pen and Paper">PnP</acronym> Celestials</li>
        <li>Added SetWeapon Preference - HotKey F, once Melee, twice Missile, Melee        designates will not switch weapons - Suggested by Hlidskialf</li>
        <li>Added SpIn683 WEB_TANGLE to the Scriptable Spells segment. This should        prevent <acronym title="Crashes to Desktop">CTDs</acronym> that some users        were experiencing in conjuction with using gMinion</li>
        <li>Added <acronym title="The Gibberlings Three">G3</acronym>'s Divine Remix:        Nightcloak of Shar - Confusion, Feeblemind, Invisible Stalker, Power Word        Stun, Shar's Curse, Chakram - &quot;Discs of Night&quot;</li>
        <li><acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> v185</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version 1.3</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Added <acronym title="Armor Class">AC</acronym> checks to druid shapes        werewolf, fire salamander, wyvern, greater werewolf, earth elemental, and        fire elemental, yes they do have enchanted attacks, which is nice until        you get a decent weapon, then I would much rather have my druid in a form        that can cast. Algorithim chosen was 3 <acronym title="Armor Class">AC</acronym> points        less that the effective <acronym title="Armor Class">AC</acronym> of the        creature that the druid polymorphs into. Moved firesalamander and werewolf        to be above wyvern </li>
        <li>Noted incompatibilty between eSeries and Refinements Shapeshift Fix component        (may investigate switching to their version as it seems to be well regarded        as a bugfix within the community) </li>
        <li>Switched to using <acronym title="Big Picture">BP</acronym> Dectectable        Spells </li>
        <li>Stripped out Sequencer Memory as it acted a bit buggy and no one seemed        to be using it </li>
        <li>Aganazzar's Scorcher wasn't being cast - Fixed - Thanks Alan George </li>
        <li>Other changes too numerous to mention </li>
        <li>Added <acronym title="The Gibberlings Three">G3</acronym>'s Divine Remix        Spells: Beast Claw, Cause Light Wounds, Cause Medium Wounds, Curse, Divine        Shell, Faerie Fire, Moonblade, Sunscorch </li>
        <li><acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> v185 </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version 1.2.09</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Imoen keeps trying to backstab my party's summoned minions when she has        free time on her hands. Fortunately, you can't backstab with a quarterstaff        ;) Modified gs_Backstab to include !Allegiance(LastSeenBy(), GOODCUTOFF)        to try and prevent such naughty behavior. </li>
        <li>Still don't know why the Sling of Everaard isn't being equipped properly        by the scripts. It seems to be the only unlimited ammo item that they have        trouble with. If someone asked me about it, I'd swear it used to work.        At least, I think I would have noticed considering how early in the game        that you can purchase it. I can't tell a difference between it and any        of the other unlimited ammo items using <acronym title="Near Infinity">NI</acronym>.        Ideas, anyone? </li>
        <li>Commented out the test displaystringhead &quot;You played Elminster?&quot; in        gs_RunAwayFriendlyFire.baf - Thanks Caedwyr </li>
        <li><acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> v155 </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version 1.2.08</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>User Request - Caedwyr </li>
        <li>Caster of <acronym title="Project Image">PI</acronym> is getting zapped        by Dispel Magic from Party Members </li>
        <li>Added Specific 206 GEPPETO to Specific.IDS </li>
        <li>Modified gs_CounterSpells (Mage, Inquisitor, and Priest), gs_HealOther_1st_4th,        gs_DefencesSpecific_TL3_Priest to check that targets !Specifics(Target,GEPPETO)        before casting the spells on a target </li>
        <li>Modified gs_HotKeyB_Mage and gs_Defences_TL4_Mage to alter the characters        scripting state when casting Project Image </li>
        <li>Need to add scripting for casting <acronym title="Project Image">PI</acronym> from        scroll? </li>
        <li>Feedback on the 'fixes' is welcome </li>
        <li><acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> v153 </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version 1.2.07</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> v148 </li>
        <li>Changed TROLALL to TROLLALL in gs_Shapechange.baf - Caught by <acronym title="Near Infinity">NI</acronym>.        Thanks to Jon Hauglid </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version 1.2.06</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> v137 </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version 1.2.05</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Potion of Fire Giant Strength (gs_Buffs_TL4_Items) checking for STR 23        instead of STR 22, Fixed! Thanks Jenny </li>
        <li><acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> v130 </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version 1.2.04</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><acronym title="Near Infinity">NI</acronym>'s nifty updated compiler        caught a couple of missing parenthesis here and there throughout the series        - Fixed! Thanks Jon </li>
        <li><acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> v124 </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version 1.2.03</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed Resist Dmg Type on Wand of the Heavens also added check for Save        vs. Wands </li>
        <li>Recoded Ring of the Ram as it was jacked, should be used more often now </li>
        <li>Recoded Harp of Pandemonium so it should now be used more often </li>
        <li>Moved the Harp of Pand and the Helm of the Rock over Ring of Energy in        gs_Attacks_TL3_Items </li>
        <li>Added check for Save vs. Wands to Wand of Electricity code </li>
        <li>Recoded Ring of Energy, corrected Resist Dmg Type check </li>
        <li>Fixed Resist Dmg Type on Wand of Fire also added check for Save vs. Wands </li>
        <li>Fixed Resist Dmg Type on CLERIC_FLAME_STRIKE, added check for Save vs.        Spells </li>
        <li>Commented out all the stuff that requires a STATE_DISEASED Check because        the state doesn't function </li>
        <li>Put the ! Back in front of CombatCounter(0) in gs_Backstab for now </li>
        <li><acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> v118 </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version 1.2.02</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reduced Magic Missiles Magic Resistance check from 91% to 75% to reduce        the chance of it being resisted </li>
        <li>Added check for resistance to magical damage in Magic Missile to increase        the odds of finding an appropriate target </li>
        <li>Used !LOS(PlayerX) to script Burning Hands and Agannazer's Scorcher -        Probably needs Testing - Thanks Grog </li>
        <li>Trying to use SetInterrupt(FALSE/TRUE) to tweak Run - From Friendly Fire </li>
        <li>Added ek_SequencerMemory.baf to eMulti and eMage </li>
        <li>Added Offensive, Defensive, and Disabling Sequencer usage to the appropriate        segments </li>
        <li>Updated gs_Antimage_TL4_Mage to check for a lot more spells that are        acceptable to try and remove </li>
        <li>Removed gs_HealSelf_Lay_Hands, gs_HealOther_Lay_Hands, gs_GoodBerries        from eMulti to keep the size of the script down </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version 1.2.01</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Moved WIZARD_BIGBYS_CLENCHED_FIST up in gs_AttacksSpecific_TL3_Mage </li>
        <li>Added Ring of Spell Turning [RING34] to item usage </li>
        <li>Added WIZARD_OTILUKES_RESILIENT_SPHERE to gs_Disablers_TL3_Mage </li>
        <li>Added WIZARD_SKULL_TRAP to gs_AttacksSpecific_TL3_Mage - Need to Load        up on Skull Traps to see if this works okay or not </li>
        <li>Fixed a bunch of incorrect resistance to damage type checks in gs_AttacksSpecific_TL3_Mage </li>
        <li>Added !Race - Dragon check to RANGER_CHARM_ANIMAL, as Dragons are defined        as General ANIMAL - Thanks Mageofthesands </li>
        <li>Dropped save vs. spells on WIZARD_CHARM_PERSON from 10 to 8 </li>
        <li>Upgraded to a <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> v116        installer </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version 1.2.00</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Added Amulet of Cheetah Speed and Bracers of Blinding Strike to item        usage </li>
        <li>Change Vocalize to HaveSpellRES usage - eventually, I'd like to change        all spell usage to HaveSpellRES </li>
        <li>Added WA2HARP to item usage </li>
        <li>Removed ! From CombatCounter(0) in gs_Backstab to more closely resemble        Len's example. I might change this back as I believe the way I had it was        working well, but I thought it might have something to do with the weapon        switching problem. </li>
        <li>Added some DisplayStringHeads to gs_Backstab to see more closely what        is going on </li>
        <li>Also uncommented out a couple of DSH's in SelectWeapon segment to try        and figure out why Imoen isn't switching weapons, I thought it was having        something to do with the backstab routine, but Yoshimo didn't exhibit the        problem with eThief, but Imoen does with eMulti and eMage. Testing to be        done </li>
        <li>Removed a Rakshasa race check from the Helm of the Rock since I am also        checking for the Rakring lower in the script </li>
        <li>Realized I had forgotten to update the OR() when I added the Item Upgrade        ranged weapons to gs_SelectRangedThenMelee_ItemList - Fixed </li>
        <li>Noted that the druid shapes brown bear and black bear were checking for        the wrong item - Fixed </li>
        <li>Added <acronym title="Armor Class">AC</acronym> checks to druid shapes        brown bear, black bear, and sword spider, yes they do have enchanted attacks,        which is nice until you get a decent weapon, then I would much rather have        my druid in a form that can cast. Need to revist the gs_DruidShapeshift        again in the future to complete the update for all shapes </li>
        <li>Re-commented the lines out in gs_SelectRangedThenMelee_ItemList when        I figured out that the problem was OR() </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version 1.1.09</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Added an InParty() check to CLERIC_NEUTRALIZE_POISON, CLERIC_REMOVE_PARALYSIS,        CLERIC_REMOVE_FEAR, and CLERIC_CURE_DISEASE, after my cleric cured a downed        troll that was poisoned. </li>
        <li>Increased the chance of clerics casting Miscast Magic and Insect Plague,        hopefully ;) </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version 1.1.08</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Changed scripting of <acronym title="Draw upon Holy Might">DUHM</acronym> so        it will not be cast when someone is right in your face because of the long        casting time, changes were to gs_PreAttack_TL1_Priest and gs_Attacks_Innate </li>
        <li>Removed RESISTMAGICFIRE check from WIZARD_COMET and WIZARD_DRAGONS_BREATH </li>
        <li>Changed FIRE resistance check to 50% for Comet and 25% for Dragon's Breath </li>
        <li>Added Save vs. Death check to Comet to increase the chance of finding        a target that will result in a proper wing buffet/unconciousness result </li>
        <li>Uncommented out the trigger in gs_Turn Undead trigger that I commented        out in v1.1.06, commenting out made the problem worse as I should have        realized if I had taken a second to think about it. </li>
        <li>Added the ranged weapons from Westley Weimer's Item Upgrade Pack to the        gs_SelectRangeThenMelee_ItemList - Thanks Caedwyr </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version 1.1.07</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Added check !Class(LastSeenBy(Myself),FIRE_ELEMENTAL) to gs_TurnUndead        because some of salamanders are defined as General - UNDEAD </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version 1.1.06</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Added !General(LastSeenBy(Myself), UNDEAD) to gs_BackStab, also commented        out the Barbarian and Gargoyle Boots clauses, see the .baf for the reasons        why </li>
        <li>Added Improved Kiithix (sp?) to gs_GlobalResets_Items, gs_HotKeyS_Items,        gs_Summons_TL4_Items (Westley Weimer's Item Upgrade Pack) </li>
        <li>Removed magic resistance check from WIZARD_DRAGONS_BREATH because the        spell bypasses it </li>
        <li>Switched to using Dyara's KIT.IDS file which is supposedly fixed more        than the previously fixed KIT.IDS ;) Thanks to Dyara and any others responsible        for figuring this one out. </li>
        <li>Added the Harp of Discord to gs_Attacks_TL2_Items, appended gs_GlobalResets_Items        to reflect the addition </li>
        <li>Added a !Range(LastSeenBy(Myself),6) trigger to the Harp of Discord as        we would prefer an enemy that we confused to have a chance of targetting        someone other than the party members. </li>
        <li>The display string that I used for the Harp of Discord was actually for        the whole item description rather than just the identified name of the        item. Fixed! </li>
        <li>Commented out the trigger in gs_TurnUndead that would allow a cleric        to start turning again if an undead creature was close enough and the timer        hadn't expired yet, because this was causing my cleric to stand there and        take a beating from Undead that were not destroyed or not turned - Maybe        I should just increase the TurnUndead Level check? </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version 1.1.05</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Changed Custom Specific.IDS #'s to correspond with the possible values        of a byte 0-255 (Don't Use 0) </li>
        <li>Fixed the error Specifics HAS_SHIELD to HAS_SHIELD in gs_AntiMage_TL4_Mage        to correspond with gs_BreachShieldCheck </li>
        <li>gs_CounterSpells_Mage - Modified True Sight to Use Custom State STATE_ILLUSIONS,        Modified Dispel/Remove Magic to use Custom State STATE_ENCHANTED, in Dispel        Magic Player Segments, changed Trigger See(PlayerX) to LOS(PlayerX,8)&hellip;just        to see if it works </li>
        <li>gs_CounterSpells_Inquisitor = Mod Inquis True Sight to Use Custom State        STATE_ILLUSIONS, Mod Dispel Magic to use Custom State STATE_ENCHANTED </li>
        <li>gs_CounterSpells_Priest = Mod Cleric True Sight and Helm True Sight to        Use Custom State STATE_ILLUSIONS, Mod Dispel Magic to use Custom State        STATE_ENCHANTED </li>
        <li>gs_CounterSpells added anti-illusionary creature use of Remove Magic&hellip;works        well the one time in the game when you need it </li>
        <li>Changed the layout of WIZARD_DETECT_INVISIBILITY and WIZARD_GLITTERDUST        to match that of WIZARD_TRUESIGHT (just for consistency) </li>
        <li>Fixed Double !Range(blah,4) in the usage of the Thieves' Hood </li>
        <li>Added the Jansen Spectroscope (Detect Invisibility 1x/day) to gs_CounterSpells_Items        and appended gs_GlobalResets_Items to reflect this </li>
        <li>Created new segment ek_DailyCreation_Items which should in theory cause        Jan to create his Flash Master Bruiser Mates daily, if he has an open inventory        slot, also works with the Cloak of the Stars, there is a nice <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym> sling        that has this effect, but I am not sure it will work with a weapon... any        others? I think only eMage and eMulti will get this segment, <acronym title="Gebhard Blucher">GB</acronym> has        this set up on a hotkey, I might be advised to do the same </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version 1.1.04</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Added BLADE_DEFENSIVE_SPIN to gs_DefencesGeneric_TL3_Rogue </li>
        <li>Added BLADE_OFFENSIVE_SPIN to gs_PreAttack_TL3_Rogue </li>

        <li>Trying to use a timer to keep track of whether I am shapechanged or not,        updates gs_Shapechange if this works, I'll try and see if I can apply it        to gs_PolymorphSelf </li>
        <li>MISC3F - Jade Hound Added to gs_Summons_TL3_Items and gs_HotKeyS_Items,        appended gs_GlobalResets_Items to reflect the addition </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version 1.1.03</strong></p>
      <ul>

        <li>Replaced GLOBALS with GLOBAL in the CounterSpell Segments and the MoveToCombat        Segment - thanks to Jon Hauglid for finding that error </li>
        <li>Fixed a coding screw up in gs_Shapechange - the revert to NATFORMx code        needed to be split into two parts (Segment still will not transform back        into natural form, need to test more) </li>
        <li>Removed EquipMostDamagingMelee() from several of the warrior and rogue        attack bonus high level abilities, because they actually apply no matter        what weapon you are using, ranged or melee </li>
        <li>Moved the SetGlobal up in the Response section of the SelectRangeThenMelee        (Item List) routine, rumor has it that it is good practice always to set        your Globals before things like Spell() actions </li>
        <li>Added SimulacrumAIChange segment to all eSeries scripts for the purpose        of identifying and changing the specifics of any party summoned Simulacrum,        Projected Image, or Mislead and also to apply the script gMinionC to the        S/PI/Mn - Removed from Public eSeries who may or may not want to use gMinion </li>
        <li>Fixed a bunch of Object Type errors throughout the scripts - Thanks to        Jon Hauglid again :) </li>
        <li>Added Vhailor's Helm [WA2HELM] to the scripts in gs_Summons_TL4_Items        and gs_HotKeyS_Items, appended gs_GlobalResets_Items to reflect the addition </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version 1.1.02</strong></p>

        <li>Fixed a couple of incorrect CheckStats() - INTELLIGENCE to INT, RESISTLIGHTNING        to RESISTELECTRICITY </li>
        <li>Fixed a couple General(LastSeenBy(),[EVILCUTOFF.0.UNDEAD.0.0]), NI didn't        like this so I changed to just UNDEAD and made sure the appropriate InParty(),        Allegiance() checks were there to compensate </li>
        <li>Fixed spelling error RANAGER_ALL to RANGER_ALL </li>
        <li>Fixed spelling error WIZARD_SUMMON_FIENDS to WIZARD_SUMMON_FIEND </li>

      <ul>

        <li>Tweaked Dispel Magic usage so the scripts would react more often to party        members with debilitating effects </li>

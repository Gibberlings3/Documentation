<p>This mod adds a joinable <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> for Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition or Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn. Amber is a tiefling rogue of a chaotic good alignment, possessed of a few special abilities. Despite being fairly     intelligent, she can at times be rather blunt when communicating with other people. This trait rarely earns her friends among the people she meets, and the feeling of initial dislike is usually mutual. But underneath her prickly manners, she has a good heart and is prepared to go to great lengths to help those who she sees to be weak and in need of aid.</p>
<p>The mod features not only romance and friendship tracks for the protagonist, but also a romance track for a second <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym> in a multiplayer game (Player 2). This feature is also exploitable in a single player game if you want enjoy two concurrent romances without cheating. For more information, check out the <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forum/69-amber/">discussion forum</a>. In addition, Amber is lavishly voiced and has her own original musical theme.</p>
<p>The quest that leads to meeting Amber begins in the streets of Athkatla, and can take place before or after your journey to Brynnlaw.</p>

      <p><strong>Enhanced Editions Note</strong><br />
      The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every   patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a   modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as   even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with   your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a   new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. For BG:EE it is important that you install the mod to the language   version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod   will not show but give error messages. </p>
      <p><strong>Windows</strong><br />
        Amber for Windows is distributed as a self-extracting   archive and includes a WeiDU installer. To install, simply double-click   the archive and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, the files can be extracted into your game directory using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a> or <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-amber.exe</strong> and the folder <strong>amber</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-amber.exe</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-amber.exe</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>Mac OS X</strong><br />
        The Amber for Mac OS X is distributed as a compressed tarball and includes a WeiDU installer.</p>
      <p>First, extract the files from the tarball into your game directory. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-amber</strong>, <strong>setup-amber.command</strong>, and the folder <strong>amber</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-amber.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-amber.command</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>Linux</strong><br />
        The Amber for Linux is distributed as a compressed tarball and does not include a WeiDU installer.</p>
      <p>Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.</p>
      <p>Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="http://www.weidu.org/%7Ethebigg/">WeiDU.org</a> and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal, cd to your game installation directory, run tolower   and answer Y to both queries. You can avoid running the second option   (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save   time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the   first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only   this mod since the last time you lowercased file names. If you're   unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.</p>
      <p>To install, run WeInstall amber in your game folder. Then run wine BGMain.exe and start playing. </p>
      <p><strong> Note for Complete Uninstallation</strong><br />
        In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely uninstall the mod using setup-amber --uninstall at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts. . </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>1. Amber, a chaotic good tiefling fighter and thief (dual class)
          as a joinable <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> with</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>a customised portrait</li>
            <li>extensive voicing in the English version and soundset for Amber in the German version</li>
            <li>original music that plays during the conversations with the <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym> (due to its infinitely looping structure it occupies one of the 17 free slots in songlist.2da)</li>
            <li>custom made <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> script (courtesy of Yovaneth)</li>

              <ul>
                <li>a friendship path for the protagonist with
                  <ul>

                  <ul>
                    <li>24 romantic interactions, of which 7 are 'floating' and 3
                      are kind of pick-up talks if things are about to go sour between
                      you and Amber</li>
                    <li>a flirt pack with unique Amber-initiated flirts and an extensive
                      set of player-initiated flirts</li>
                    <li>a romance conflict with Viconia, Jaheira and Aerie; Amber

                    <li>the Bodhi abduction quest</li>
                  </ul>

                <li>a romance with another suitable male player character in a multiplayer
                  game if the protagonist is not agreeable, with
                  <ul>
                    <li>customised friendly interactions and lovetalks to replace
                      those suitable only to the protagonist</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>2 or 3 regular banters with all Bioware <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> and
              a set of scripted banters with Imoen, Viconia and Haer'Dalis</li>
            <li>up to 47 interjections and reactions to conversations between the
              player character and non-party <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym>,
              plus additional 24 interjections with minor citizens of Amn</li>
            <li>Tree of Life with different options depending on your relationship
              with Amber</li>
            <li>special interjections, banters and more for the Underdark</li>
            <li>a string fixer (SHIFT-k) in case, for example, re-installation mixes
              up her soundset and name strings in old savegames</li>
            <li>3 mini-quests with copious dialogue, new areas (edited from original
              game areas) and voicing for six non-party <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym></li>
            <li>several brand new items, some more useful than others, along with
              an upgrade to the Blade of Roses</li>
            <li>small tweaks including
              <ul>
                <li>corrected spear animations: more stabbing and less swinging</li>
                <li>corrected Haer'Dalis' blades description texts: they're usable
                  only by Haer'Dalis, not by all tieflings</li>
                <li>corrected kit.ids and added <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym> scripting
                  functions</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>and a hilarious Easter Egg to boot! *Now includes singing and music!*</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>2. Multiplayer-friendly flirting for Amber</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Flirting with Amber will not pause the entire game. The other players
              are free to do their shopping, adjust inventories of their characters
              etc., and you can make out with your sweetheart without annoying your
              co-players. This is an optional component that will be of use mostly
              to multiplayers.</li>

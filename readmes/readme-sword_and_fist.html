<p>Sword and Fist adds new options for those using warrior classes: Fighters,      Monks and perhaps eventually Barbarians. It is designed for use with either <a href="http://www.pocketplane.net/tutu/">Baldur's      Gate Tutu</a> or Baldur's Gate II. It was originally intended to form part      of the Lands of Intrigue mod, but a decision was made to split the kits off      into smaller mods (both for ease and so something would actually get released      in a reasonable timeframe).</p>
  <p>All components are optional.    </p>

<p>This mod is designed to work with <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> (without the expansion pack Throne of Bhaal), the Tutu or BG Tconversion projects, or the Enhanced Editions of Baldur's Gate, Baldur's Gate II, and Icewind Dale. HLAs will be available for games with Throne of Bhaal content.</p>
<p>Because the monk fists are hardcoded in the original games, the Monk Remix component is only available for Windows players of the original games since it involves an exe hack. This was softcoded for the Enhanced Editions, so Monk Remix is available for all platforms on these games. </p>
<p>The Duskblade uses the barbarian HP table. Unfortunately, in the original games this can lead to crazy HP totals if used in conjunction with a max HP rol mod like the one in Tweaks Anthology. Again, this is softcoded and therefore not a problem for the Enhanced Editions. </p>

      <p><strong>Special Note for Siege of Dragonspear from Steam/GOG<br />
      </strong>Good Old Games (GOG) and Steam both package the additional content for Siege of Dragonspear in a method that WeiDU, the tool used to install this mod, cannot access. You must  run a program called <a href="https://forums.beamdog.com/discussion/50441/modmerge-merge-your-steam-gog-zip-based-dlc-into-something-weidu-nearinfinity-dltcep-can-use/p1">Modmerge</a> on your SoD installation  before you can install this or any other WeiDU-based mod. </p>
      <p><strong>Enhanced Editions Note</strong><br />
        The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every   patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a   modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as   even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with   your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a   new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. For BG2:EE it is important that you install the mod to the language   version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod   will not show but give error messages. </p>
      <p><strong>Windows</strong><br />
        Sword and Fist for Windows is distributed as a self-extracting   archive and includes a WeiDU installer. To install, simply double-click   the archive and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, the files can be extracted into your game directory using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a> or <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-sword_and_fist.exe</strong> and the folder<strong> sword_and_fist</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-sword_and_fist.exe</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-sword_and_fist.exe</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>Mac OS X</strong><br />
        Sword and Fist  for Mac OS X is distributed as a compressed tarball and includes a WeiDU installer.</p>
      <p>First, extract the files from the tarball into your game directory. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-sword_and_fist</strong>, <strong>setup-sword_and_fist.command</strong>, and the folder <strong>sword_and_fist</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-sword_and_fist.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-sword_and_fist.command</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>Linux</strong><br />
        Sword and Fist  for Linux is distributed as a compressed tarball and does not include a WeiDU installer.</p>
      <p>Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.</p>
      <p>Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="http://www.weidu.org/%7Ethebigg/">WeiDU.org</a> and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal, cd to your game installation directory, run tolower   and answer Y to both queries. You can avoid running the second option   (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save   time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the   first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only   this mod since the last time you lowercased file names. If you're   unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.</p>
      <p>To install, run WeInstall sword_and_fist in your game folder. Then run wine BGMain.exe and start playing. </p>
      <p><strong> Note for Complete Uninstallation</strong><br />
        In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely uninstall the mod using setup-sword_and_fist --uninstall at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts. . </p>

<p>Each component is separate and optional. The list of components is as follows:</p>
 <p><strong>Monk Remix</strong><br>
    <em>Available for all Enhanced Edition games, or the original Windows versions of BG2/Tutu/BGT</em></p>
  <p>This component changes Monks to bring them more in line with their 3rd Edition
    pen-and-paper counterparts. Their class description becomes as follows:</p>
  <div class="kit_description">
    <p>MONK: Monks are warriors who pursue perfection through action as well
      as contemplation. The key feature of the monk is his ability to fight unarmed
      and unarmored. Thanks to his rigorous training, he can strike as hard as
      if he were armed and strike faster than a warrior with a sword. </p>
    <p>Though a monk casts no spells, he has a magic of his own. He channels
      a subtle energy, called ki, which allows him to perform amazing feats,
      the best known of which is the ability to stun an opponent with an unarmed
      blow. As a monk gains experience and power, his mundane and ki-oriented
      abilities grow, giving him more and more power over himself and, sometimes,
      over others. </p>
    <p>Monks may be of any Lawful alignment. </p>
    <p>Advantages: <br>
      - Gains a +2 bonus to maximum unarmed damage at 1st, 4th, 8th and 12th
        levels, and a +4 bonus at 16th, 20th and 24th levels.<br>
      - Gains a +1 bonus to minimum unarmed damage at 12th and 24 levels. <br>
      - Gains 1/2 an extra unarmed attack per round every 3 levels (starts at
      3rd level, ends at 18th level with a total of 4 unarmed attacks per round). <br>
      - Fists are considered magical weapons at 4th level, +1 at 10th, +2 at
      16th, +3 at 22nd, +4 at 28th, +5 at 34th, and +6 at 40th. <br>
      - Gains a +1 bonus to all saving throws at 2nd and 9th levels. <br>
      - Gains a +2 bonus to saving throws vs. spells at 3rd level. <br>
      - Gains a +1 bonus to Armor Class every 5 levels (starts at 5th level).<br>
      - Gains a +1 bonus to Armor Class vs. missiles every 3 levels (starts at
      2nd level). <br>
      - Gains a +1 bonus to movement rate every 3 levels (starts at 3rd level). <br>
      - Gains immunity to disease at 5th level. <br>
      - Gains immunity to poison at 11th level. <br>
      - Gains magic resistance equal to current level + 10 at 13th level. <br>
      - Gains immunity to charm at 20th level. <br>
      - Gains immunity to non-magical weapons at 20th level. <br>
      - May use 'Flurry of Blows' ability once per day. The monk gains 1 additional
      attack per round for the next turn, but also suffers -4 <acronym title="To-Hit Armor Class 0">THAC0</acronym> penalty.
      This penalty is reduced to -3 at 5th level, -2 at 9th level, and -1 and
      13th level. <br>
      - May use 'Stunning Fist' ability once per day per level. All attacks made
      by the monk in the next round force the victim to save or be stunned. NOTE:
      this special ability automatically modifies a Monk's normal attack, so
      no targeting needs to be done. <br>
      - May use 'Wholeness of Body' ability once per day at 7th level. The monk
      heals a number of his own hit points equal to twice his current level. <br>
      - May use 'Quivering Palm' ability once per day at 15th level. The monk's
      next successful melee attack sets up vibrations in the target's body, causing
      it to save vs. death or die. NOTE: this special ability automatically modifies
      a Monk's normal attack, so no targeting needs to be done. <br>
      - May use 'Empty Body' ability once per day per level at 19th level. The
      monk assumes an ethereal state for 1 round, becoming invisible and immune
      to immune to all damage, but also unable to launch any attack. <br>
      - Can Hide In Shadows and Move Silently. <br>
      - Can Find Traps. <br>
      - Can read clerical scrolls. </p>
    <p>Disadvantages: <br>
      - Cannot wear any armor. <br>
      - Cannot make use of shields. <br>
      - Can only use one-handed weapons available to the thief class. <br>
      - Cannot dual-wield. <br>
      - May only be proficient with his permitted weapons. </p>
  </div>
  <p><strong>Install Hexblade Fighter Kit</strong></p>
  <p>This component will install the Hexblade fighter kit.</p>
  <div class="kit_description">
    <p>HEXBLADE: Combining the dynamic powers of martial prowess and arcane might,
      the Hexblade presents a deadly challenge to opponents unused to such a
      foe. Hexblades adventure for personal gain, whether that gain is power,
      prestige, wealth, or all the above. The style of the Hexblade is selfish,
      sometimes even cruel, and even the friendliest-seeming Hexblade is typically
      self-serving. Their magic aids them in combat, and they specialize in cursing
      their foes. </p>
    <p>Hexblades are able to use their magic while wearing armor, and may be
      of any non-good alignment. </p>
    <p>Advantages:<br>
      - Gains a +1 bonus to saves vs. spells. An additional +1 bonus is gained
        at level 11.<br>
      - May cast Doom once per day per 5 levels.<br>
      - From level 4, may cast Charm Person and Sleep once each per day. An extra
      use is gained at level 8.<br>
      - From level 7, may cast Greater Malison once per day. Extra uses are gained
      at levels 14 and 20.<br>
      - From level 8, may cast Invisibility and Mirror Image once each per day.
      An extra use is gained at level 12.<br>
      - From level 12, may cast Protection from Normal Missiles and Vampiric
      Touch once each per day. An extra use is gained at level 16.<br>
      - From level 16, may cast Improved Invisibility and Polymorph Other once
      each per day. An extra use is gained at level 20. </p>
    <p>Disadvantages:<br>
      - May only Specialize (2 stars) in weapons.<br>
      - <acronym title="To-Hit Armor Class 0">THAC0</acronym> does not improve
      at levels 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20.<br>
      - May not dualclass.</p>
    <p>A Hexblade may pick the Wizard spells of Power Word: Blind, Silence or
      Stun as <acronym title="High Level Abilities">HLAs</acronym>, each useable
      once per day, in addition to the normal choice available to a Fighter.
      These are cast in the same manner as their other spells. </p>
  </div>
  <p><strong>Install Duelist Fighter Kit</strong></p>
  <p>This component will install the Duelist fighter kit.</p>
  <div class="kit_description">
    <p>DUELIST: The Duelist is the happy-go-lucky hero with the ready wit and
      the flashing rapier. He's happiest when he's in the big city, but can be
      an imposing warrior anywhere-enemies often underestimate him because of
      his charming manners and don't realize that he can hold his own in the
      melee as well as anyone else. Attacking with a trademark speed and grace,
      the Duelist's agility makes up for their disdain for heavy armor or large
      weapons. The Duelist, because he's bright and well-spoken, often becomes
      party leader... or at least the leader's spokesman. </p>
    <p>Duelists are found among all races and alignments. </p>
    <p>Advantages:<br>
      - Gains a +1 bonus to weapon speed factor, <acronym title="To-Hit Armor Class 0">THAC0</acronym> and
      damage per 10 levels.<br>
      - Gains a +1 bonus to armor class per 5 levels. </p>
    <p>Disadvantages:<br>
      - Grand Mastery may only be attained using single-handed, bladed weapons.
        All other weapons, and the Two-Handed Weapon fighting style, are limited
        to one proficiency point.<br>
      - May not wear armor heavier than studded leather. </p>
  </div>
  <p><strong>Install Fist of Order Fighter Kit</strong></p>
  <p>This component will install the Fist of Order fighter kit.</p>
  <div class="kit_description">
    <p>FIST OF ORDER: While many view the Fists simply as efficient (if brutal)
      mercenaries, they are in fact templars sworn to the service of their unforgiving
      deities--typically Iyachtu Xvim, son of the dead Bane, Lord of Tyranny.
      Members are also sometimes found among other militaristic and Lawful faiths,
      such as that of Helm. The world is a dark and unforgiving place, or so
      says the Church of Xvim, wherein the strong survive by ruling the weak
      and forging order from the chaos. To support its dogma, the Church established
      this elite company of templars and made them available for hire to those
      whose causes complemented the Church's ultimate goals (and who could, naturally,
      afford to pay the hefty tithes necessary to maintain a crack unit of well-armed
      and well-trained men and women). The Fists are infamous for their efficient
      brutality: nowhere will an employer in need of military aid locate mercenaries
      more dedicated to ensuring that the rule of law prevails over the forces
      of anarchy and confusion. </p>
    <p>Fists of Order must be of Lawful Evil, Neutral Evil or Lawful Neutral
      alignments. They sacrifice mastery of any single weapon in favor of the
      highly efficient use of many types of weapon, allowing them to act as most
      appropriate for the situation at hand. </p>
    <p>Advantages:<br>
      - Gains a +1 bonus to <acronym title="To-Hit Armor Class 0">THAC0</acronym> per
      6 levels.<br>
      - From 4th level, gains a +1 bonus to damage per 6 levels.<br>
      - From 7th level, may cast Cloak of Fear once per day. Extra uses are gained
      at levels 14 and 20. </p>
    <p>Disadvantages:<br>
      - May only Specialize (2 stars) in weapons.</p>
  </div>
  <p><strong>Install Blackguard Fighter Kit</strong></p>
  <p>This component will install the Blackguard fighter kit.</p>
  <div class="kit_description">
    <p>BLACKGUARD: The Blackguard epitomizes evil. The quintessential black knight,
      this villain carries a reputation of the foulest sort that is truly well-deserved.
      Consorting with fiends and serving dark deities, the blackguard is feared
      by all. Some people call these villains anti-Paladins due to their completely
      evil nature. </p>
    <p>The comparison with Paladins is an apt one, for where the Paladin serves
      their deity in the name of Law and Good, to the benefit of all civilized
      creatures, the Blackguard does the bidding of their fell master and seeks
      to increase only their own power. </p>
    <p>Blackguards may be of any Evil alignment. </p>
    <p>Advantages:<br>
      - May use Lay on Hands on himself once per day, healing the Blackguard
        2 hit points per level.<br>
      - May cast Detect Good and Protection from Good each 3 times per day. These
      are analogous to Detect Evil and Protection from Evil, except deal with
      Good creatures.<br>
      - From level 5, may coat his weapon in poison once per day per 6 levels.
      Attacks made in the next round will inject the poison into the target,
      dealing out 1 damage per second for 24 seconds (3 damage for the first
      6 seconds). A saving throw vs. poison limits damage to 12 total.<br>
      - From level 7, may cast Animate Dead once per day. Extra uses are gained
      at levels 14 and 20. </p>
    <p>Disadvantages:<br>
      - May only Specialize (2 stars) in weapons.<br>
      - May not dualclass.<br>
      - A Blackguard whose reputation exceeds 14, or ceases to be of Evil alignment,
      is forever cursed by his deity and loses all special powers. He is thereafter
      treated as a Fighter, except he is still limited to Specialization in weapons. </p>
    <p>The Blackguard's <acronym title="High Level Ability">HLA</acronym> table
      is the same as the standard Fighter table, with the addition of Summon
      Fallen Deva. </p>
  </div>
  <p><strong>Install Duskblade Fighter Kit</strong></p>
  <p>This component will install the Duskblade fighter kit.</p>
  <div class="kit_description">
    <p> DUSKBLADE: The duskblade blurs the line between spellcaster and warrior,
      marrying the power of magic with hand-to-hand combat prowess. A student
      of ancient elven spellcasting techniques, the duskblade combines arcane
      spellcasting with the combat skills of a fighter. While the ability to
      cast arcane spells in armor originated with the elves, over the millennia
      the secrets of the duskblade have been disseminated to the other races
      and today members of any race can become a duskblade. </p>
    <p> Duskblades are able to use their magic while wearing armor up to and
      including splint mail, and may be of any non-evil alignment. </p>
    <p> Advantages: <br>
      - From level 4, may cast Entropic Shield and Magic Missile once each per
        day. An extra use is gained at level 8 and 12. Entropic Shield forms
        a magical residue providing mild protection from all ranged attacks.
        The shield has a 20% chance of deflecting a missile attack away from
        the caster. This lasts for 5 rounds per 4 levels of the caster. <br>
      - From level 7, may cast Melf's Acid Arrow once per day. Extra uses are
      gained at levels 14 and 20. <br>
      - From level 8, may cast Remove Magic and Haste once each per day. An extra
      use is gained at level 12. <br>
      - From level 12, may cast Greater Malison and Stoneskin once each per day.
      An extra use is gained at level 16. <br>
      - From level 16, may cast Breach and Phantom Blade once each per day. An
      extra use is gained at level 20. </p>
    <p> Disadvantages: <br>
      - May only Specialize (2 stars) in weapons. <br>
      - May not dualclass. <br>
      - May not use bows or missile weapons <br>
      - Can only wear armor up to and including splint mail </p>
    <p> A Duskblade may pick the Wizard spells of Tenser's Transformation, Mantle
      or Mordenkainen's Sword as <acronym title="High Level Abilities">HLAs</acronym>,
      each useable once per day, in addition to the normal choice available to
      a Fighter. These are cast in the same manner as their other spells. </p>

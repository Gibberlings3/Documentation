    <div class="section">
<p>The <strong>Level 1 <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym></strong> mod derives from Gebhart        Blucher's <a href="http://www.fortunecity.com/boozers/winelodge/79/bgstuff/bgstuff.html">Alternate <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym></a> (lvl1npcs.zip) mod. <strong>Azazello</strong> recommended updating it for <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>, <strong>cmorgan</strong> further promoted it for development and <strong>Nythrun</strong> formally        coded the mod and made it monstrous (in a good way, of course).</p>
<p> The mod is called &quot;Level 1&quot; because the <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> thus modded start as level one        characters with excess experience points. When they join your party, you        can level them up and choose their skills. Their experience points end up        being the same as if they had joined your party without the mod        installed.</p>
<p> Blucher's mod allowed players to use kits and classes that are different        from the default ones assigned to several default <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym>. The mod allowed only a limited        number of kit and class choices, to only a few <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym>.</p>
<p> <strong>Level 1 <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym></strong> expands on the original        concept by allowing players to assign <strong><em>any</em></strong> installed kit/class - default or customized - onto <strong><em>any</em></strong> default <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> from <strong><em>both</em></strong> <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym> and <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> games. The mod also allows players to        change the <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>'s skills        and weapon proficiencies.</p>
<p> Cernd the Monk, Mazzy the Paladin, Jaheira the Kensai and Valygar the        Wizard Slayer are just a few examples. The combinations are endless and        the choices are purely up to the players interests.</p>
<p> The extra benefit of the mod is that it allows the player to try        customized kits from other mods, and to apply them to as many default <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> in the game as        desired.</p>
<p> You can read more details in the mod's <strong><a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/index.php?showforum=140">forum</a></strong> and its <strong><a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=12239"><acronym title="Frequently Asked Questions"> FAQ</acronym></a></strong> thread. Please report any bugs or suggestions        for improvements in the mod's forum. </p>

    <div class="section">
<p>This mod works with <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>:        Shadows of Amn, with or without the expansion pack Throne of Bhaal. If        you do not have Throne of Bhaal installed, you will not be able to assign        any kits based on the wild mage. Make sure        your game has the latest patch before installing any fan-made mods: for <acronym title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</acronym> that would be 23037 and        for games including <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym> it's 26498.        Do not under any circumstances install the beta patch version 26499,        as it's likely to make your game uncompletable. Check the ReadMe files         related to your patch in your game folder and the <a href="http://www.bioware.com/support/games/">BioWare</a> website if necessary.</p>
<p> This mod is designed to work with all other mods, including <a href="http://www.pocketplane.net/tutu/">Baldur's Gate Tutu</a> (and EasyTutu)        and <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/index.php?showforum=261">Baldur's        Gate Trilogy</a>. We gently suggest installing the <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg2fixpack/"><acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> Fixpack</a> for all platforms except        Tutu. If you decide not to include it, we may not be able to help you        with any in-game bugs or bugs added by Baldurdash.</p>
<p> You can install this mod during an existing game, but the modifications        will only take effect if the <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> has not yet joined the party.</p>
<p> Although you can install the mod anywhere in a mod list, you should place        it near the end of your mod list. If you want to assign an <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> a <em>customized</em> kit, be sure to install <strong>Level 1 <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym></strong> <em>after</em> the custom        kit mod. If you want to use <a href="http://www.pocketplane.net/aoe/">Ashes of        Embers</a> or another mod that changes the weapon proficiency rules,        then that should also go earlier so this mod will follow the changed        ruleset.</p>
<p> If you'd like to install the <strong><acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym>-style proficiencies</strong> component of <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/tweaks/">Tweaks Anthology</a>, you may now install that        before <strong>Level 1 <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym></strong> and it should correctly        pick up those proficiencies. You may also install it after Level 1 <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym>.</p>
<p> If you have installed the Revised High Level Abilities component of <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/index.php?showforum=116">Refinements</a>,        a kitted multiclass will crash the game upon whichever level-up would allow        selection of an <acronym title="High Level Ability">HLA</acronym>. This is not        a bug in <strong>Level 1 <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym></strong> - do not tempt fate by kitting any multiclasses with <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/index.php?showforum=116">Refinements</a> installed        and consider deferring that gnome cleric/(obligatorily)illusionist protagonist        until another playthrough.</p>

      <p><strong>Enhanced Editions Note</strong><br />
        The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every   patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a   modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as   even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with   your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a   new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. For BG2:EE it is important that you install the mod to the language   version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod   will not show but give error messages. </p>
      <p><strong>Windows</strong><br />
         Level One NPCs for Windows is distributed as a self-extracting   archive and includes a WeiDU installer. To install, simply double-click   the archive and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, the files can be extracted into your game directory using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a> or <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-level1npcs.exe</strong> and the folder<strong> level1npcs</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-level1npcs.exe</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-level1npcs.exe</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>Mac OS X</strong><br />
         Level One NPCs  for Mac OS X is distributed as a compressed tarball and includes a WeiDU installer.</p>
      <p>First, extract the files from the tarball into your game directory. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-level1npcs</strong>, <strong>setup-level1npcs.command</strong>, and the folder<strong> level1npcs</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-level1npcs.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-level1npcs.command</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>Linux</strong><br />
         Level One NPCs  for Linux is distributed as a compressed tarball and does not include a WeiDU installer.</p>
      <p>Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.</p>
      <p>Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="http://www.weidu.org/%7Ethebigg/">WeiDU.org</a> and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal, cd to your game installation directory, run tolower   and answer Y to both queries. You can avoid running the second option   (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save   time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the   first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only   this mod since the last time you lowercased file names. If you're   unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.</p>
      <p>To install, run WeInstall level1npcs in your game folder. Then run wine BGMain.exe and start playing. </p>
      <p><strong> Note for Complete Uninstallation</strong><br />
        In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely uninstall the mod using setup-level1npcs --uninstall at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts. . </p>

<p><strong>List party-joinable <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym></strong> - <em>Required for all        other components</em></p>
<p>
  This component scans and indexes all standard <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> in your game. It also corrects        creatures using the wrong effect version. You can also &quot;batch uninstall&quot;        all components you've previously installed by uninstalling this        component.</p>
<p> <strong>Tweak weapon proficiencies for some classes</strong> - <em>Optional</em></p>
<p>
  This component alters weapon proficiency rules like other mods such as <a href="http://www.pocketplane.net/aoe/">Ashes of Embers</a> or <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/index.php?showforum=79">Rogue Rebalancing</a>,        with specifics described below.<br />
</p>
<p>When you're altering the joinable <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym>, this mod follows whatever rule        set is in place. So if you want mages to be able to use crossbows, and        you want Edwin to have to crossbow proficiency, you'll need to change the        rules so that this mod will know what rules to follow. Most of the        content here mirrors other mods and is presented as convenience, or as an        alternative to the many mods that must be installed last.</p>
<p> You can: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Allow clerics one star in any weapon type a fighter can use; if          your deity's weapon is a sword, you should bloody well be able to use a          sword! :) At this prompt you may choose to allow clerics one star (which          will skip the following five changes by default), choose amongst          the following options separately, or skip all cleric-related tweaking. </li>
  <li>If you refused &quot;one star in anything for clerics,&quot; allow          cleric/mages one star in mage weapon types (1 for daggers and darts or          2 for daggers only). </li>
  <li>If you refused &quot;one star in anything for clerics,&quot; allow          cleric/thieves one star in thief weapon types (1 for all thief weapons,          2 for short swords and daggers or 3 for daggers only). </li>
  <li>If you refused &quot;one star in anything for clerics,&quot; allow          cleric/rangers one star in ranger weapon types (1 for all weapons,          2 for longswords and longbows, 3 for longswords only or 4 for longbows          only). </li>
  <li>If you refused &quot;one star in anything for clerics,&quot; allow          fighter/clerics two stars in any weapon type - just using the fighter          restrictions rather than the cleric's, as fighter/mages and          fighter/thieves already do. Choosing &quot;2&quot; allows only axes in addition          to standard cleric weapons. </li>
  <li>If you refused &quot;one star in anything for clerics,&quot; allow          fighter/mage/clerics two stars in any weapon type. Choosing &quot;2&quot; allows          only daggers in addition to standard cleric weapons. I'm sure you can          make up your own mind. :) </li>
  <li>Allow druids one star in any weapon type a fighter can use. This          will allow fighter/druid multiclasses the full gamut of weapons          available to fighters (as per second edition <acronym title="Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons">AD&amp;D</acronym> rules). </li>
  <li>Restrict fighter/druids from armors single class druids cannot wear          - by request; seems closer to the arbitrary 2nd edition rules in any          case. This component will be automatically skipped if you have installed          Druid Remix from <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/cleric">Divine Remix</a> or <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/item_rev">Item Revisions</a>, as          they already include this change. </li>
  <li>Allow weapons mastery for fighter multiclasses - some will find it          cheesy, but if you were going to get this elsewhere (e.g. <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> Tweaks), then you might          as well have it for party joinables too. You may limit this to mastery          (3 stars), high mastery (4 stars) or grand mastery (5 stars). </li>
  <li>Allow melee weapons mastery for for barbarians - as above, but          pertains only to non-ranged weapons. You may limit this to mastery          (3 stars), high mastery (4 stars) or grand mastery (5 stars). </li>
  <li>Allow thieves, mages and bards to place one star in any weapon type. </li>
  <li>Allow thieves and thief multiclasses three stars in dual-wielding          - a la aVENGER's <a href="http://rogue.rebalancing.googlepages.com">Rogue          Rebalancing</a>, <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/sns">Song and Silence</a>,          and probably a dozen other mods :) (and will be skipped if you have this          tweak already installed from somewhere else) </li>
  <li>Allow backstab with any weapon a mage/thief, fighter/thief or          cleric/thief can use. Backstabbing with a two-handed sword shouldn't be          less effective than backstabbing with a quarterstaff, yes? </li>
  <li>Make quarterstaves unusable for backstabbing - by request. </li>
  <li>Make all two-handed weapons unusable for backstabbing - note that in the          unmodded game, the only two-handed weapon that is capable of backstabbing          is the quarterstaff, so this isn't going to do much unless you've already          installed the &quot;allow backstab with thief multiclass weapons&quot; subcomponent. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Add kits to exported characters</strong> - <em>Optional</em></p>
<p>
  This component allows brave cheaters, er, players to assign a kit to an          exported <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym>. Most          people who'd consider doing that will probably use an editor like <acronym title="Dragonlance Total Conversion Editor Pro">DLTCEP</acronym> or <acronym title="Near Infinity">NI</acronym> instead :). You cannot          use this component to assign a kit to a character already kitted.          Nor can you uninstall the component normally, as it makes no changes to          your actual game. You can, however, restore characters in the          level1npcs/backup/2 folder if you aren't happy with your changes. It is          always wise to keep an extra backup also, just in case.</p>
<p> <strong>Joinable <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> more closely match the <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym>'s experience</strong> - <em>Optional</em>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>On initial joining only</li>
  <li>On initial joining and rejoining</li>
</ol>
<p><acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym>, upon joining, will        have their total experience points adjusted to a value closer to that of        the player character. Feedback will display in the game window to let you        know what's going on and when it ends so you can let this component do its        work. After the experience points have been adjusted, the character will        have a one-time-only rest script (so that you may fill their spell slots at        your discretion). To use this, make sure that the AI lantern in the         bottom right corner of the game screen is activated, select the character,        and press R. Return to the main screen and your character will now be rested        (and you may turn the AI off if you prefer). This script is self-effacing: it        will go away if you rest, leave the area, save the game, change party members,        or do almost anything else, so if you want to use it, you'd best do so as soon as        the experience points have stopped twitching. As a side benefit, it's easy to         ignore if you don't want it.</p>
<p> <strong>Balanced <acronym title="Baldur's Gate 1">BG1</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> attributes</strong> - <em>Optional; Tutu and BGT only</em></p>
<p>
  This component adjusts the attributes of <acronym title="Baldur's Gate I">BG1</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym>, as discussed in <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=15001">this topic</a>.        The original mod is by Ergopad; mos_anted made some slight adjustments        (as discussed later in the topic). Therefore, you've got two choices        (or three since you can skip it entirely, as will happen anyway if you're        installing on <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>).</p>
<p> <strong>Dudleyfix for <acronym title="Baldur's Gate 1">BG1</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym></strong> - <em>Optional; Tutu and BGT only</em></p>
<p>
  This component &quot;fixes&quot; the attributes of <acronym title="Baldur's Gate I">BG1</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym>, as discussed in <a href="http://forgottenwars.com/dudleyfix/bg1_npcs.htm">this link</a>.        Primarily, this addresses various inconsistencies as noted on that page.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Fix <acronym title="Baldur's Gate 1">BG1</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> spells and innate abilities</strong> - <em>Optional; Tutu and BGT only</em></p>
<p>
  As above, this fixes various glitches in spell books and innate abilities.        This is the last of Ergopad's 3 components, offered here for convenience        prior to making future <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> tweaks.</p>
<p> <strong>Update game references to <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> classes/kits</strong> - <em>Optional</em></p>
<p>
  This component does nothing in itself, but enables the changing of game        dialogues, item descriptions and character biographies that reference        an <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>'s class or kit <em>if</em> you have        changed that class or kit. It is very select; for example, it does not        change a cleric's deity mentioned in dialogue you've changed the kit,        though if you change the class, the cleric may become referred to as a        paladin (or whatever) of said deity. Changes should be logged to the        batchlog/l1dlg.txt file. Please attach this to the forum if you wish to        report any discrepancies while using this component (which is optional,        if we didn't mention it already).</p>
<p> <strong>Change Anomen's knighthood reward/penalty</strong> - <em>Optional; BG2 and BGT only</em></p>
<ol>
  <li>Wisdom +1 on passing (instead of set to 16)</li>
  <li>Wisdom +1 on passing; Constitution +1 on failing</li>
  <li>Wisdom +1 on passing; Wis -1 and Con +1 on failing</li>
  <li>Wisdom +1 on passing; Wisdom -1 on failing</li>
</ol>
<p>On passing his knighthood test, Anomen would normally get his wisdom set        to 16, regardless of what it had been previously (normally 12). This        component will augment his wisdom by 1 instead (if, for example, you want        to increase his wisdom in the &quot;Mod an <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>&quot; component). You also have four        choices to change his attributes if he fails the test.</p>
<p> <strong>Mod an <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym></strong> - <em>Optional</em></p>
<p>
  These components allow you to change the classes and/or kits of        individual <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> installed in your game. You can choose from any class available,        including multiclasses. After that, you can choose to assign one kit        related to the class(es) you assigned. The engine does not allow        assignment of more than one kit. However, you can choose from any        mod-introduced kits available. Of course, you can also decide not to        assign a kit. </p>

<p>Thanks to Gebhart Blucher for the original concept and mod for changing        the assigned kits of several default <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym>. He has given us his explicit        encouragement to expand on his concept.</p>

  </ul>

    <li>Fixed: armed and armoured Viconia at the stake in <acronym title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</acronym></li>

    <li>Fixed: kitted multiclasses were limited to kit weapon proficiencies, now          limited to base multiclass proficiencies instead, as that's what takes effect in-game</li>

  </ul>
  <strong>Version 1.2: Rebuilding Berlin One Newline At A Time. (17Jan09)</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Updated to <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> v210</li>
    <li>erik's Repaired tp2 newline for German versions</li>
  </ul>
  <strong>Version 1.1: Poland's Translating, London's Calling. (20Aug08)</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Updated to <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> v208</li>
    <li>Added yarpen's Polish translation</li>
  </ul>
  <strong>Version 1: First Official Release (23Dec07)</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Updated to <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> v203; small WeiDU bug in PRETTY_PRINT_2DA hacked around </li>
    <li>Changes made to the weapon proficiency rules now apply to any kits          added by mods as well </li>
    <li>New option in the <strong>Tweak weapon proficiencies for some           classes</strong> component: Restrict all two-handed weapons from bonus          backstab damage </li>
    <li><acronym title="Experience Point">XP</acronym> adjuster slightly          recoded </li>
    <li>Added rest script to <acronym title="Experience Point">XP</acronym> adjuster </li>
    <li>Some paucity of spells (i.e. 1-2) will be memorized before joining </li>
    <li>Yes/no prompt for retaining Minsc rage </li>
    <li>Quickslot/inventory prompt for expatriating Boo </li>
    <li>Optional Boo annihilation added for your cruel pleasure. It's           less fun than it might sound. </li>
    <li>Added the option to abort the install of a component by entering 0          at the class selection menu, to make those &quot;Oops! I didn't mean to press          [A]!&quot; errors less painful </li>
    <li> <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/index.php?showforum=261"> <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym></a> users only:           if the Level Zero NPCs component of <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/scs/"> <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym></a> has been           installed, it will now be possible to modify the Shadows of Amn           incarnations of a given <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>.           It's still preferable that you not install that particular component of           DavidW's mod along with this mod, but it doesn't cause any (known) problems :) <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym> really is rather          good, by the way. </li>
    <li>Omission of unselectable kits recoded to avoid issues with new          versions of <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/index.php?showforum=116"> Refinements</a> et al. </li>
    <li>Illegal mage kit multiclasses no longer penalized with their weapon          proficiency assignments (again) </li>
    <li>Fixed Imoen not always receiving her sorcerer spells </li>
    <li>Optional restriction of fighter/druids from druid-unusable armors          will not display if the Druid Remix component of <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/cleric/">Divine Remix</a> is installed,           as something identical is already included in that mod </li>
    <li>Thief/mages occasionally receiving chainmail in their automatic          new equipment assignment (as though they were bards) fixed </li>
    <li>Added code to fix hdragsil.cre if broken by a conflict between <a href="http://www.pocketplane.net/quest/">Quest Pack</a> and <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/scsii/"><acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems II">SCS II</acronym></a> (won't be making a          habit of this). In addition, some small and pitiful amount of bugfixes          to items introduced by other mods is gradually being incorporated,          though only when necessary to prevent errors when installing this          mod. Prevention of crashes is but collateral damage. </li>
  </ul>
  <strong>Version 0.7: Ultimate Beta Revisited (with new improved        spellchecking)! (19Oct07)</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Updated readme and <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> to v201; renamed to          &quot;level1npcs&quot; because there seems to be a bunch of versions floating          around out there; packaged for <acronym title="The Gibberlings Three"> G3</acronym></li>
    <li>Fixed regexp to catch aerie10.cre; no other significant code          touched (cmorgan just ogled and whistled at it while studying it) </li>
  </ul>
  <strong>Version 0.6: Ultimate Beta! (31May07)</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Added a new component to allow <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> to have an <acronym title="Experience Point">XP</acronym> total closer to the <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym>'s upon joining. I'm discontent with it          at the moment. </li>
    <li>Removed the remainder of the bugfixes (exception: effect version          for Tutu creatures) in the interests of compatibility </li>
    <li>Fixed a problem (?) with fighter/thief hitpoints </li>
    <li>Fixed a problem with fighter/non-mage kitted multiclasses receiving          an overly restrictive menu of weapon proficiencies </li>
    <li>Removed some typo corrections that were applied to original game          files; no one else cares that avengers are referred to as BEAST_FRIEND          which was dropped before <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>'s release :) </li>
    <li>Added a Divine Remix style option to restrict fighter/druids from          armors single class druids cannot wear. It's in the weapon proficiency          tweaks, and it's optional in an optional component :). </li>
  </ul>
  <strong>Version 0.5: Barely Beta! (31Mar07)</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Updated to <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> v199. There are still a few cases where I'm using some stupid hack          rather than a nice <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> action, but things in general          ought to work better. Please note that this mod cannot run on <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> versions          earlier than 199: the bigg has fixed too many bugs and added too many          new features. </li>
    <li>Completely rebuilt primary component; installation ought to proceed          much more quickly. Consequently, most of the creature correction          routine has been removed. Please let me know if the mod chokes on any          creatures and I'll endeavor to fix them on a case-by-case basis. </li>
    <li>Completely rewrote the weapon assignation routine; it should be          slightly stingier now. Please report any cases of duplicating items to          me so that I may kill myself or fix any remaining bugs, depending on my          mood at the time. </li>
    <li>Completely rewrote the armor assignation routine too </li>
    <li>Weapons that have usability restrictions altered by the mod will          have their descriptions updated. We've lost the 3,600 character regular          expression and reverted to a simpler match, so it should be much faster          than the original. </li>
    <li>Mages will have one spell and specialist mages two spells memorized          when met in game, as a courtesy to those who have no time to rest.          Priests will come with a Cure Light Wounds. Sorcerers come with their          own peculiar mechanical implementation. </li>
    <li>Sorcerer kits that select fewer than two spells at first level can          be added now. Uh, who is making sorcerer kits, again? </li>
    <li>Deprecated the &quot;Kit exported characters&quot; subcomponent, as the          coding was far too advanced for my own good (i.e. it causes terrible          problems upon uninstall because I am an idiot). Sorry about that. Flee          this component. </li>
    <li> <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> Imoen's Magic Missile          wand had entirely too many charges; now it has ten </li>
    <li>Includes swank HTMLed readme. Thanks, Miloch! </li>
    <li>TP2 now contains a few comments. Not many. May add more. Feeling          terse. </li>
  </ul>
  <strong>Version 0.4: Beta! (20Mar07)</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Major bug that could delete files fixed. I have done the impossible          with <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>, and it          sucked a lot. </li>
    <li>Fixed a bug that prevented installation </li>
    <li>Auto-skipping of unavailable <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> actually works now </li>
    <li>Fixed a bug that caused multi-classes with Mage kits to receive an          unduly restrictive selection of weapon proficiencies </li>
    <li>Code to skip adding items to <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> who shouldn't have any actually          works now (OR and AND are not equivalent in respectible truth tables,          silly!) </li>
    <li><acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> with super          special weapons will now have their proficiencies with that weapon          incremented by one if they have some already </li>
    <li>Cleaned up some slop in a couple macros (no effect, but tidier) </li>
    <li>Added component which allows kitting of exported characters if they          have none already. Be very careful with this. </li>
    <li>Removed GROUP usage that was wasting time and accomplishing          nothing. </li>
    <li>Commented out the item description updater - it's just too slow </li>
  </ul>
  <strong>Version 0.3: Alpha Three (8Mar07)</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Corrected a bug where some kits received weapon proficiencies from          the next kit in kitlist.2da </li>
    <li>Gave sorcerers their second level one spell (whoops!) </li>
    <li>Blocked <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPCs</acronym> from displaying in          Tutu </li>
    <li>Added code to convert any creature effect version to v2          automatically (this has to be done to prevent LOCALS from being          truncated if over eight charcters, and to make sure they can be saved) </li>
    <li>Fixed typo in class selection menu </li>
    <li>Blocked barbarians from being selectable as a multiclass (sorry,          hardcoded hitpoint funk here; I can't make this work well) </li>
    <li>Two-handed weapons will now be equipped (unless you've selected          another weapon afterwards, naturally :) ) </li>
    <li>Made cleric/mages use the (correct) cleric avatar rather than the          mage avatar </li>
    <li>Xan's Moonblade will now be a longsword usable by whatever Xan is,          and he'll get a proficiency point in longsword for free whether that's          normally allowed or not: this represents his deep spiritual bond with          the weapon in the only way the uncouth <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> engine can express :) </li>
    <li>Fixed a bug where <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> would stockpile weapons in their          inventory; should be one per customer, iron crisis or no </li>
    <li>Made the armor assignation for <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> a bit less generous </li>
    <li>Added a bloated preliminary component that allows tampering with          weapon proficiency rules. While there are other, standalone mods that          do this, if you want altered rules to apply for this mod, those altered          rules would have to be installed first. So I'm doing it for you :). </li>
    <li>Forced barbarian and wild mage symbols to take a value of 0 in          kit.ids </li>
  </ul>
  <strong>Version 0.2: Alpha Two (16Feb07)</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Approximately Moser's number worth of bugs fixed </li>
  </ul>
  <strong>Version 0.1: Alpha One (2Feb07)</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Let us never speak of this again </li>

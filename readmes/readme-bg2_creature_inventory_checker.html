<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p> This utility was something I developed while working on
    the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> Fixpack. Near Infinity has some excellent debugging
    tools which were used as a first pass
    in corrections to creature files. However, after running
    (and correcting) the couple hundred errors that turned up,
    I found there was no tool for finding, say, creatures with
    a weapon in their weapon slot but not equipped, or a creature
    with armor in a shield slot, and a number of other miscellaneous
    errors I wanted to correct. </p>
</div>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p><strong>Windows</strong><br />
    The <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2 </acronym>Creature
    Inventory Checker is packaged and installed with <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> and
    is distributed as a self-extracting archive. To install,
    simply double-click the archive and follow the instructions
    on screen. </p>
  <p> Alternatively the files can be extracted from the archive
    using <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/">WinRAR</a>. If properly
    extracted, you should have a BG2_Creature_Inventory_Checker
    folder and Setup-BG2_Creature_Inventory_Checker.exe in your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2 </acronym>folder. </p>
  <p>To use this utility,  run Setup-BG2_Creature_Inventory_Checker.exe
    in your  <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2 </acronym> folder. The utility will search through all creature
    files present in the game and report errors to the DEBUG
    file. </p>
  <p><strong>Mac OS X</strong><br />
    <em>If the mod was previously installed, uninstall it before
    extracting the new version. </em>The <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2 </acronym>Creature
    Inventory Checker is packaged
    and installed with <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>.
    To install, simply extract the contents of the mod into your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2 </acronym>folder.&nbsp; If
    properly extracted, you should have a BG2_Creature_Inventory_Checker
    folder, Setup-BG2_Creature_Inventory_Checker, and Setup-BG2_Creature_Inventory_Checker.command
    in your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder.</p>
  <p>To use this utility, run Setup-BG2_Creature_Inventory_Checker.exe
    in your  <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2 </acronym> folder. The utility will search through all creature
    files present in the game and report errors to the DEBUG
  file. </p>
</div>
<h2>Contents</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>The <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2 </acronym>Creature
  Inventory Checker is a <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> mod, in a sense. The uility uses
    <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> to search and run checks against creature files, but
    does not leave a weidu.log entry so it can be run multiple
    times without interfering with mods. The utility uses a series
    of PATCH_PRINT commands to report errors. These reports will
    appear in the installation window, but will be too fast to
    be caught by the eye. Fortunately, they're logged in the
    DEBUG file. </p>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> The utility works by searching through the resources in a creature's inventory by loading up the referenced items and performing automated checks on the item files. As a result, if the item reference is incorrect and the item does not exist, the utility will fail and exit with an error message. It is recommended that you run Near Infinity's &quot;Find Illegal ResourceRefs...&quot; (under Tools) on creature files and correct any mistakes there before proceeding with this tool. Random treasure items (rndtre01, rndtre02, etc.) are ignored by this utility and will not cause the program to halt. </p>
  <p>The error messages are all prefixed with ItemErr: to allow
    for easy searching within the DEBUG file.</p>
  <p><strong>ItemErr: Bow with no arrows; ItemErr: Sling
    with no bullets; ItemErr: Crossbow with no bolts </strong></p>
  <p>These errors are all caused by a similar issue: the creature
    has a launcher in its weapon slot, but lacks the requisite
    ammunition in the quiver slots. </p>
  <p><strong>ItemErr: Arrows with no bow; ItemErr: Bullets with
  no sling; ItemErr: Bolts with no crossbow </strong></p>
  <p>Similar to the previous errors, but in this case the creature
    has ammunition in its quiver slots but no weapon with which
    to use it. </p>
  <p><strong>ItemErr: Invalid Helm; ItemErr: Invalid Armor; ItemErr:
    Invalid Amulet; ItemErr: Invalid Ring; ItemErr: Invalid Cloak</strong>;
    <strong>ItemErr: Invalid Gloves </strong></p>
  <p>All of these errors are caused by having an invalid item
    equipped. For example, if a creature has an item not of the
    type armor (2) in its armor, this error will be
    reported. Many of the rings and amulet errors will be spurious,
    as BioWare tended to use these slots for special items that
    give creature immunities and other special abilities for
    their creature type. As many of these items are not flagged
    with proper item types you will see a number of errors.</p>
  <p><strong>ItemErr: Invalid Weapon </strong></p>
  <p>You will see this error if the creature has an item in its
    weapon slot that does not have a melee (1), ranged (2), or
    launcher (4) ability. Originally, this was only a check against
    item type, but there were a number of spurious errors resported
    as many of the creature paws (such as b1-8.itm) are of the
    type Miscellaneous (0).</p>
  <p><strong>ItemErr: Invalid offhand</strong></p>
  <p>This error is caused by having an item in the offhand/shield
    slot that is not a one-handed weapon or a shield. The offhand
    weapon must be melee-only (ranged weapons are not allowed
    offhand) and not  flagged as two-handed. </p>
  <p><strong>ItemErr: Invalid quiver    </strong></p>
  <p>This error is generated by an item in the quiver slot that
    is not arrows, bullets, or bolts.</p>
  <p><strong>ItemErr: Invalid weapon equipped  </strong></p>
  <p>The utility will perform a compare against the equipped
    weapon value and the weapon slots. This error is reported
    if there is 1) a valid weapon available and 2) either no
    weapon selected or the selected slot has no valid weapon.
    So if a creature has weapon slot 1 set as equipped but has
    no weapons at all, this error will <em>not</em> be generated
    as condition #1 is not satisfied. </p>
  <p><strong>ItemErr: Two-handed weapon and offhand item </strong></p>
  <p>This error is triggered by one of the weapons in the weapon
    slots being flagged as two-handed while the offhand/shield
    slot is filled. This would cause a hard crash in BG2 if such
    a creature were encountered.</p>
  <p><strong>ItemErr: Possible equippable item in inventory </strong></p>
  <p>The utility is also looking for items that were possibly
    meant to be assigned. As such, it performs a check in a creature
    inventory for armor, shields, helms, etc. to see if an item
    could be equipped rather than left in inventory. </p>

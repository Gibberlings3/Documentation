<h2> Notes </h2>
<div class="section">
  <p> Please completely uninstall previous versions before installing this version.
    PLEASE NOTE: Any <acronym title=
        "Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> you've modified that's joined the
    party won't revert to normal upon uninstalling the mod: at that point they're
    permanently stored in the saved game rather than just afloat in the override.
    You must start a completely new game to make changes. </p>
</div>
<h2> Components </h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>Loosely based on Gebhart Blucher's "Alternate <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym>" mod
    from way back in the day, suggested for update by Azazello, supported by
    cmorgan and coded/made monstrous by Nythrun (hi there!). </p>
  <p><strong>Primary Component</strong></p>
  <p> This serves two purposes: the first is that it corrects creatures using
    the wrong .eff version, the second is that it allows you to "batch uninstall" all
    components you might have installed by uninstalling it. That's about it. </p>
  <p> <strong>Optional: Tweak the weapon proficiency rules</strong></p>
  <p> When you're altering the joinable <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym>,
    this mod follows whatever rule set is in place. So if you want mages to be
    able to use crossbows, and you want Edwin to have to crossbow proficiency,
    you'll need to change the rules so that this mod will know what rules to
    follow. Most of the content here mirrors other mods and is presented as convenience,
    or as an alternative to the many mods that must be installed last.</p>
  <p> You can: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Allow druids one star in any weapon type a fighter can use. </li>
    <li>Allow grandmastery for fighter multiclasses - some will find it cheesy,
      but if you were going to get this elsewhere (e.g. <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> Tweaks)
      then you might as well have it for party joinables too. </li>
    <li>Allow thieves and thief multi-classes three stars in dual-wielding -
      a la aVENGER's Rogue Rebalancing </li>
    <li>Allow backstab with any weapon a mage/thief, fighter/thief, or cleric/thief
      can use - Backstabbing with a two-handed sword shouldn't be less effective
      than backstabbing with a quarterstaff, yes? </li>
    <li>Make quarterstaves unusable for backstabbing - by request. </li>
    <li>Restrict Fighter/Druids from armours single class Druids cannot wear
      - by request, seems closer to the arbitrary 2nd Ed rules in any case. </li>
    <li>Allow clerics one star in any weapon type a fighter can use - If your
      deity's weapon is a sword, you should bloody well be able to use a sword!
      :) </li>
    <li>If you refused "one star in anything for clerics", Allow fighter/clerics
      and fighter/mage/clerics two stars in any weapon type - just using the
      fighter restrictions rather than the cleric </li>
    <li>If you refused "one star in anything for clerics", Allow cleric/thieves
      one star in any weapon type a fighter can use - otherwise cleric-thieves
      can only backstab with quarterstaves and clubs, and it's a bit dull. </li>
    <li>If you refused "one star in anything for clerics", Allow cleric/rangers
      two stars in any weapon type - I'm sure you can make up your own mind :) </li>
  </ul>
  <p> <strong>Optional: Mod exported <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym>s</strong></p>
  <p> Currently deprecated as it's dangerous to uninstall. Brave users can, if
    they so desire, undeprecate it, change an exported <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym>,
    copy that <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym> elsewhere, and uninstall
    this component. Most people who'd consider doing that will probably use an
    editor like <acronym title="Dragonlance Total Conversion Editor Pro">DLTCEP</acronym> or <acronym title="Near Infinity">NI</acronym> instead
    :) Since I know of no method that will allow this work both correctly and
    unintrusively, for now it's staying unavailable. </p>
  <p> <strong>Optional: Joinable <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> more
      closely match the <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym>s experience</strong></p>
  <p> <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym>, upon joining, will
    have their <acronym title="Experience Points">XP</acronym> total adjusted
    to something closer to the <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym>'s.
    This component is new to the last beta, and I don't much like the implementation
    at this point. It'll be revised, eventually. </p>
  <p> <strong>Optional: Mod an <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym></strong></p>
  <p> Pick one and go nuts. Or don't :) </p>
</div>
<h2> Q&amp;A </h2>
<div class="section">
  <p> <strong>Q: So, what's this do, then?</strong></p>
  <p> A: You're offered a list of the <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> who
    can join your party and share your kooky adventures. You can choose to tamper
    with some or all or none of them. Let's say you've chosen Minsc. You can
    assign him any class that a <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym> could
    have (Ranger Minsc! Fighter/Thief multi Minsc! Sorcerer... erm, Minsc!).
    After selecting a class, you can assign a kit (if you like). The list of
    kits you're offered is any kit that's installed in your game that the class
    you've chosen could select. Thus, if you've turned Minsc into a Fighter/Thief
    multi, you can give him any fighter kit or any thief kit (Berserker/Thief?
    No problem. Rather have Fighter/ Swashbuckler? No problem. Weimer's Anti-Paladin/Thief?
    Well, if you're sure....). Note: you can advance in only one kit at a time
    and cannot have two. This is hardcoded and will not be changed by this mod.</p>
  <p> After, say, turning Minsc into a Berserker/Thief, you get to spend his
    forty thief skill points that he gets for first level. Put them all in Move
    Silently if you want to replicate his old ranger ways, or put them into Pickpockets
    and Detect Illusion if that's more fun. It's your game. Then you get to pick
    your starting weapon proficiencies. Lastly, if you're a Sorcerer you pick
    your two first level spells.</p>
  <p> Now when you meet Minsc in game, whenever you meet Minsc in game, he'll
    be a level one Berserker/Thief - but while his level has been changed, his
    experience hasn't been. So when you meet him in Chateau Irenicus, you'll
    be able to immediately level him to whatever level his 89,000 experience
    would allot him, and reap all the usual benefits :)</p>
  <p> <strong>Q: That sounds complicated and time consuming. Why didn't you just
      set the <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> to level
      zero like I do with Shadowkeeper and skip this long sequence of selection
      menus?</strong></p>
  <p> A: Because leveling from zero to one doesn't give you the correct amount
    of thief skill points nor weapon proficiencies. If I'd done that, your party
    members would be permanently short - or - I'd have to pick where to assign
    this stuff for you, which rather defeats the purpose of the mod, doesn't
    it?</p>
  <p> <strong>Q: Isn't the concept here kind of cheesy?</strong></p>
  <p> A: Perhaps :) It really depends on what you do with it and where your threshold
    for cheese lies. For example, I've always thought it silly that Jaheira shows
    up in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> specialized in club
    just because the game designers wanted to show off their absurd-looking and
    weak new weapon type. No one likes clubs, and she's carrying a quarterstaff
    in her <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> portrait for crying out
    loud! If this bothers you, you can change her into a fighter/druid with no
    kit and put her proficiencies where Ms "Speak Sharply and Carry a Huge Blunt
    Object" ought to have them.</p>
  <p> <strong>Q: That's fine. But you can do sillier things with the mod too,
      right?</strong></p>
  <p> A: Sure. It's worth noting that BioWare was quite content to break the "rules" whenever
    they thought it would make a character more vivid or interesting. Minsc lacks
    the requisite wisdom to be a ranger. Aerie is a multi-class that elves can't
    have. Anomen's wisdom is too low for him to have legally dualed to cleric.
    You're just getting that option now too.</p>
  <p> <strong>Q: Yeah, but I turned Kagain and Korgan into paladins with your
      mod, and it was stupid.</strong></p>
  <p> A: I bet. Don't do that. I can't tell where you draw the line, so you will
    have to make your own choices.</p>
  <p> <strong>Q: What about the <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym>'
      stuff? What happens to it?</strong></p>
  <p> A: All of their "generic" items (e.g. Chainmail, Longsword +1) are removed.
    They get a new outfit of "generic" items based on the class that you've picked
    for them. If you make Imoen a Swashbuckler and give her proficiency in short
    bow and short sword, then she'll show up in Candlekeep with a short bow,
    twenty arrows, a short sword, and some variety of leather armor.</p>
  <p> Signature items are a little more complicated; in the case of, say, Haer'Dalis's
    Chaos and Entropy blades, he'll keep them, and the weapons themselves will
    be altered so that he can use them regardless of whatever class he is (Fighter/Mage?
    Fine, they're Fighter/Mage usable now. Cleric? Uh... okay, he can still use
    them, and he'll get his special bonus star in shortswords even though Clerics
    can't normally use this kind of weapon.)</p>
  <p> In the case of Monks some difficulty ensues: their offhand slot is permanently
    occupied because of the kludgy way they're implemented. So it does no good
    to make a shield Monk usable if they can't ever equip it. Signature items
    for Monks are converted: two-handed sword becomes katana, shield becomes
    cloak (shields can be worn over the back ;) ), etc, etc. It's not perfect,
    but I can't change the way Monks work.</p>
  <p> <strong>Q: So, it's possible I might get better stuff when I recruit an <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>?</strong></p>
  <p> A: Yep. Since it's always been possible to take <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> on
    the "Quest to Find What's at the Bottom of that there Woodchipper" and pawn
    their worldly possessions, I'm not too worried about this. The items they
    end up with should be fairly close to what a standard <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> gets:
    if you notice any glaring omissions or errors, let me know :)</p>
  <p> <strong>Q: Lots of <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> have
      special flavor innate abilites, what about those?</strong></p>
  <p> A: They're kept; innate abilities are not changed by this mod. Branwen
    will still have her Spiritual Hammer if she's a Fighter/Cleric. Minsc will
    still have his headwound rage if you make him a Berserker. <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>-only
    priest or wizard spells, on the other hand, have to be explicitly assigned.
    I can make sure that Jaheira always knows Harper's Call if she can cast spells
    (and in fact, that's already done ;) ) but I have to know in advance that
    it's a "special" spell. Anything I've missed, let me know :)</p>
  <p> <strong>Q: What about <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> added
      by mods? Keto wants to be a skald!</strong></p>
  <p> A: None at this time. While I find it hypocritical for modders to declare
    their work sacrosanct, there's certainly a contingent who expect to have
    free reign trampling BioWare's intentions and other modders intentions and
    the player's intentions while expecting their own work to be pedestaled higher
    than, say, Shakespeare. So mod <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> aren't
    and won't be included without permission. With that said, Wes Weimer won't
    care if his <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> are included,
    and J. Compton will probably allow <acronym title="Pocket Plane Group">PPG</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> to
    be included if we all buy stock in Broken Hourglass, so it's possible some
    will show up later :)</p>
  <p> <strong>Q: Hitpoints?</strong></p>
  <p> A: If you're playing on core or below, maximum. If you're playing on difficult,
    anywhere between half maximum and maximum. If you're playing on insane, random.</p>
  <p> <strong>Q: Let's talk about install order.</strong></p>
  <p> A: I sure don't like mandatory install orders. Install <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> or <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> and <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym>.
    Make sure they've got the latest patch. If you're playing Tutu, install the
    latest Easy Tutu version; if you're playing <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym>,
    install the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> Fixpack and the
    latest <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym> version. <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> Fixpack
    is gently suggested; if you decide not to include it, I may not be able to
    help you with any in-game bugs or bugs added by Baldurdash.</p>
  <p> Other than that, it doesn't really matter. If you want to assign a kit
    from a mod, you'll need to install that kit first (otherwise I've no way
    of telling that you plan to install it later). If you want to use Ashes of
    Embers or something else that changes the rules for weapon proficiencies
    around, then that also should go earlier so that this mod will follow the
    changed ruleset. </p>
</div>
<h2> Known Issues </h2>
<div class="section">
  <p> Please report any bugs you notice in this release in the Gibberlings Three
    forum thread above. I'll do my best to improve this based on your feedback
    :) </p>
  <p> <strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong></p>
  <p> Any <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> you've modified
    that's joined the party won't revert to normal upon uninstalling the mod:
    at that point they're permanently stored in the saved game rather than just
    afloat in the override. While it's not impossible to mod saved games (just
    annoying ) it's not in general a good idea, as scanning through a list of
    saves for altered files is pretty much impossible to do without errors of
    the game exploding kind. I'm not sure why there'd be a problem with Yoshimo's
    dialogues, though - it'll be a bit before I'll have a chance to look into
    this. </p>
  <p> <strong>Q: Oct 14 2007, 01:03 PM, J Beau:</strong></p>

    I uninstalled the Revised Hell Trials from the Questpack and then it installed
    just fine.</i></p>
  <p> <strong>Nythrun:</strong></p>
  <p> The hdragsil.cre problem is a conflict between Quest Pack and <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCSII</acronym> -
    you should be able to work around it by installing the Hell Trials bit of
    Quest Pack after <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCSII</acronym> (and
    after anything else that might be modifying the dragons); if you don't, taking
    the evil path in the Pride[?] trial will crash your game. Of course, you
    won't get the updated AI this way. It's not really an error on anyone's part,
    but it should be easy enough for Sim or DaveW to work around. </p>
  <p> <strong>Q: vagrant_winds, Oct 17 2007, 05:47 PM:</strong></p>
  <p> <i> After the 1st component of lvl1npcs is installed, when starting a new
      game and choosing &lt;CHARNAME&gt;'s class, if I chose Assassin, all alignments
      at the "Alignment" screen would be greyed-out out and non-selectable, meaning
      character creation was unable to finish with that kit. Until an alignment
      is chosen, the "Next" button is unelectable to continue on to rolling Attributes...
      and there's no allignment to select. It's possible that this could be a
      conflict between 1lv1npcs and Avenger's Rogue Rebalancing. I've had the
      same issue weather or not lvl1npcs is installed first or near the end,
      but I do not recall if I've had an install with lvl1npcs that hasn't had
      Agenger's Rogue Rebalancing on it too. </i> </p>
  <p> <strong>Nythrun:</strong></p>
  <p> Unselectable Assassins: there was a bug in some early versions where I
    corrected the internal spelling of a few kits in one place and not in another,
    which left no valid alignments for those kits. If you're using Beta6, it's
    probably an incompatibility that needs looking into.</p>

      Tutu creatures). It's in the interests of compatibility. </li>
    <li>Fixed a problem (?) with Fighter/Thief hitpoints. </li>
    <li>Fixed a problem with Fighter/Non-Mage kitted multiclasses recieving and
      overly restrictive menu of weapon proficiencies. </li>
    <li>Removed some typo corrections that were applied to original game files;
      no one else cares that Avengers are referred to as BEAST_FRIEND which was
      dropped before <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>'s release
      :) </li>
    <li>Added a Divine Remix style option to restrict Fighter/Druids from armors
      single class Druids cannot wear. It's in the weapon proficiency tweaks,
      and it's optional in an optional component :) </li>
  </ul>
  <p> <strong>Version Five: Barely Beta! (31Mar07)</strong> </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Updated to <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> 199.
      There are still a few cases where I'm using some stupid hack rather than
      a nice <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> action,
      but things in general ought to work better. Please note that this mod cannot
      run on <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> versions
      earlier than 199: the Bigg has fixed too many bugs and added too many new
      features. </li>
    <li>Completely rebuilt primary component; installation ought to proceed much
      more quickly. Consequently, most of the creature correction routine has
      been removed. Please let me know if the mod chokes on any creatures and
      I'll endevour to fix them on a case-by-case basis. </li>
    <li>Completely rewrote the weapon assignation routine; it should be slightly
      stingier now. Please report any cases of duplicating items to me so that
      I may kill myself or fix any remaining bugs, depending on my mood at the
      time. </li>
    <li>Completely rewrote the armor assignation routine too. </li>
    <li>Weapons that have usability restrictions altered by the mod will have
      their descriptions updated. We've lost the 3,600 character regular expression
      and reverted to a simpler match, so it should be much faster than the original. </li>
    <li>Mages will have one spell and specialist mages two spells memorized when
      met in game, as a courtesy to those who have no time to rest. Priests will
      come with a Cure Light Wounds. Sorcerers come with their own peculiar mechanical
      implementation. </li>
    <li>Sorcerer kits that select fewer than two spells at first level can be
      added now. Uh, who is making sorcerer kits, again? </li>
    <li>Deprecated the "Kit exported characters" subcomponent, as the coding
      was far too advanced for my own good (i.e. it causes terrible problems
      upon uninstall because I am an idiot). Sorry about that. Flee this component. </li>
    <li><acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> Imoen's Magic Missile wand
      had entirely too many charges; now it has ten. </li>
    <li>Includes swank htmled readme. Thanks, Miloch! </li>
    <li>.tp2 now contains a few // comments. Not many. May add more. Feeling
      terse. </li>
  </ul>
  <p> <strong>Version Four: Beta! (20Mar07)</strong> </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Major bug that could delete files fixed. I have done the impossible with <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>,
      and it sucked a lot. </li>
    <li>Fixed a bug that prevented installation. </li>
    <li>Auto-skipping of unavailable <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> actually
      works now. </li>
    <li>Fixed a bug that caused multi-classes with mage kits to receive an unduly
      restrictive selection of weapon proficiencies. </li>
    <li>Code to skip adding items to <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> who
      shouldn't have any actually works now (OR and AND are not equivalent in
      respectible truth tables, silly!) </li>
    <li><acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> with super special
      weapons will now have their proficiencies with that weapon incremented
      by one if they have some already. </li>
    <li>Cleaned up some slop in a couple macros (no effect, but tidier) </li>
    <li>Added component which allows kitting of exported characters if they have
      none already. Be very careful with this. </li>
    <li>Removed GROUP usage that was wasting time and accomplishing nothing. </li>
    <li>Commented out the item description updater - it's just too slow. </li>
  </ul>
  <p> <strong>Alpha Three (8Mar07)</strong> </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Corrected a bug where some kits received weapon proficiencies from the
      next kit in kitlist.2da. </li>
    <li>Gave sorcerers their second level one spell (whoops!) </li>
    <li>Blocked <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPCs</acronym> from
      displaying in Tutu. </li>
    <li>Added code to automatically convert any creature effect version to v2
      (this has to be done to prevent LOCALS from being truncated if over eight
      charcters, and to make sure they can be saved). </li>
    <li>Fixed typo in class selection menu. </li>
    <li>Blocked barbarians from being selectable as a multiclass (sorry, hardcoded
      hitpoint funk here, I can't make this work well). </li>
    <li>Two-handed weapons will now be equipped (unless you've selected another
      weapon afterwards, naturally :) ) </li>
    <li>Made cleric/mages use the (correct) cleric avatar rather than the mage
      avatar. </li>
    <li>Xan's Moonblade will now be a longsword usable by whatever Xan is, and
      he'll get a proficiency point in longsword for free whether that's normally
      allowed or not: this represents his deep spiritual bond with the weapon
      in the only way the uncouth <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> engine
      can express :) </li>
    <li>Fixed a bug where <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> would
      stockpile weapons in their inventory, should be one per customer, Iron
      Crisis or no. </li>
    <li>Made the armor assignation for <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> a
      bit less generous. </li>
    <li>Added a bloated preliminary component that allows tampering with weapon
      proficiency rules. While there are other, stand-alone mods that do this,
      if you want altered rules to apply for this mod, those altered rules would
      have to be installed first. So I'm doing it for you :) This component has
      received no testing whatsoever, be warned :) </li>
    <li>Forced barbarian and wildmage symbols to take a value of 0 in kit.ids. </li>
  </ul>
  <p> <strong>Alpha Two (16Feb07)</strong> </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Approximately Moser's number worth of bugs fixed. </li>
  </ul>
  <p> <strong>Alpha One (2Feb07)</strong> </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Let us never speak of this again. </li>
  </ul>

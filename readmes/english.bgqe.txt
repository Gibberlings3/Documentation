			Baldur's Gate Mini Quests and Encounters
					Modification 
	for BG1:TotSC, BG1Tutu v4, EasyTutu, BGT, BG:EE, and EET
					by jastey 
					Version 15

Baldur's Gate Mini Quests and Encounters Modification (BGQE) is a mod for "vanilla" BG1 (with the add-on Tales of the Sword Coast), BG1Tutu v4, EasyTutu, BGT, BG:EE, and EET, adding several small quests and encounters to the game. Vanilla BG1 without TotSC is no longer officially supported, but it should still work for it.

The duration of the game time added by this mod is approximately 30 to 60 minutes, depending on playing style.

Since Version 9, the Bjornin Extention is moved to the RE BG1 mod (Romantic Encouters for BG1). That is where it belonged all along.



DESCRIPTION

1. Slime Quest

This quest is located in Beregost. If you pass one of the houses in the northwest, a woman dressed in red should approach you. There are some strange things going on in the house of her neighbor, and she wants your help.

This release revises the quest to meet known compatibility issues and adds a (more) evil quest solution. 

2. Family Treasure Quest

This quest is also located in Beregost. If you go into another house in the northwest, you will meet a strange couple. They obviously have a serious problem, but haven't talked to each other for some time now. Although it seems that they aren't interested in talking to you either, it might just be that you can solve the riddle and ease their worries... or betray them and ruin the family completely.

3. Babysitting in Nashkel, including Carnival Encounter

This quest occurs in Nashkel. Did you meet the desperate mother of two little children? She has something important to do, and is in great need of a trustworthy person who will watch over her children while she is away. So, fearless monster fighter, will you be ready for this challenge?

The babysitting is only available for paladin PCs or for non-evil aligned PC's with reputation higher than 12. Evil PCs can bully the mother away, which will lead to a follow-up.

At the Nashkel carnival, you can find Tina. The young woman is another tragic soul in need of some money... or so she says.

4. Monster in Nashkel

Near the Manor House in Nashkel you can save little Arnim from a monster that's chasing him. He is staying with his parents in the Nashkel Inn. For such a heroic deed, the thankfulness of his parents should be all yours... shouldn't it?

The delivery man who mixed up the egg deliveries will be met later in the game. One of his customers is very, very unhappy about what he got and both will be delighted to see you. 

5. Fallen Paladin in Baldur's Gate

In the northern part of the city, in the temple of Helm, an evil fallen paladin is hiding. He slaughtered a little girl without hesitation... at least that's what the angry people in front of the temple are saying.

6. Undying Love in the Fishing Village

The frightened woman in the left house tells you she is threatened by a monster hiding behind her house. Maybe you should go and take a look?

7. Lovesick Half-Orc

On the road north of Nashkel, you meet Uguth. He is on his way to Baldur's Gate, to his beloved. Due to his appearance, being clearly descended from orcs, he has to overcome a special hindrance before he can take her into his arms.

8. Unexpected Help

In the Candlekeep infirmary, glum Sir Trun seeks healing from his wounds. He was injured badly in a fight, but that doesn't seem to be his actual problem, as Linda, his fiancee who is staying in Candlekeep Inn, can tell you...
This quest is accessible both during the Prologue or after the return to Candlekeep. Note: Since most players finish this quest in the prologue, there are no NPC reactions for this quest.

Note: The "Extension of Bjornin Encounter" is moved to "bg1re: Romantic Encounters for BG1" where it belongs.

9. Many little paws

Formerly meant as an Easter Egg quest I figured it makes sense to tell players it's actually there. Make sure you have Minsc in your party when talking to the vendor at the Nashkell Carnival. Everything else will develop from there - promise!

Spoiler:
The pet vendor will reappear after three ingame days at the 3rd level of the Friendly Arm Inn.

10. A Warm Place for Noober

Approximately three days after the first Noober contact in Nashkel, your PC will witness an oxymoron: a Noober who cannot talk! Show mercy and find a kind soul ready to take him in and help him to cure his sickness - and also a place where, finally, Noober can put his talkativeness into good use, as well.


INSTALLATION

Note: If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting the new version. To do this, uninstall all previously installed components and delete the mod folder and executables. When installing or uninstalling, do not close the DOS window by clicking on the X button! Instead, press the Enter key when instructed to do so.


BGII:EE
If you use BGII Enhanced Edition from GOG or Steam, you need to prepare your game with modmerge before installing any mods:
https://forums.beamdog.com/discussion/50441/modmerge-merge-your-steam-gog-zip-based-dlc-into-something-weidu-nearinfinity-dltcep-can-use/p1

 
General (Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux)
Make sure you back up your game acordingly, just to be sure. 

Extract the contents of the mod archive to your game's main directory. 
NOTE: For BG:EE it is important that you istall the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages.


Windows
On successful extraction, there should be an bgqe folder and a setup-bgqe.exe file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click setup-bgqe.exe and follow the instructions on screen.
Run setup-bgqe.exe in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.

Mac OS X
Make sure you have the Mac OS X version of the mod (named "OSX-BGQE-vx.zip"). If properly extracted, you should have a bgqe folder, setup-bgqe, and setup-bgqe.command in your game's main directory folder. To install, simply double-click setup-bgqe.command and follow the instructions on screen.

Linux
Make sure you have the Linux version of the mod (named "lin-bgqe-vx.zip").
Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from WeiDU.org and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal, cd to your BG installation directory, run 'tolower' and answer Y to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you have already ran it once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered, so there is no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names) either if you have extracted only this mod since the last time you lower cased file name. If you are unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.
Run WeInstall setup-bgqe in your game folder to install the mod. Then run wine BGMain.exe and start playing.


NOTE: BG(II):EE are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. 


If you have installation problems or encounter any bugs, please post your bug report in one of the forum threads given below.

COMPATIBILITY

Baldur's Gate Mini Quests and Encounters Mod is coded using WeiDU and does not overwrite any files. It should be compatible with most other (WeiDU) mods. 

If you play it with the original BG, the mod is compatible with
-Echon's "Field of the Dead" (Version 1.07)

For original BG, the mod should also be technically compatible with (this does not necessarily imply that the listed mods are all compatible with each other):
-BG1 Unfinished Business
-NTotSC (non-WeiDU)
-Grey Clan Episode 1
-Herbs and Potions Add-In
-BG1 Adventure and CoM Forge
-BG1 Ajantis Expansion Mod
-Xan Friendship Mod

For Tutu please look into "Tutu Mod Compatibility and Order of Install" at G3:
http://gibberlings3.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=8122

Compatibility with BG1 Ajantis Expansion Mod is fulfilled.

I want to thank all who have helped me making this mod.

Have fun playing this quest mod!

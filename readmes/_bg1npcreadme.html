<h2>Overview</h2> 
<div class="section"> 
  <p>This mod expands on the depth of character and levels of interaction with
    the <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> from the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> game.
    When <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> was released, one of
    the major improvements in many peoples' eyes was the increased level of interaction
    one could have with the party members. This mod was developed to allow <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> players
    a similar experience. <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> in
    your party now have banters with the <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym>,
    with each other, and small side-quests of their own. As we were unable to
    get the original character voice actors to voice all the new lines, we instead
    sought out music appropriate to each <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> to
    be played whenever they initiate banter. This musical package is a separate,
    optional package (to keep the download size down), and you can find it on
    The Gibberlings Three download page.</p>

<h2>Compatibility</h2> 
<div class="section"> 
  <p>This mod is designed to work on Tutu v4, EasyTutu, and and <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym>, all based
    on full, patched installs of Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate II. Neither
    the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> expansion Throne of Bhaal
    nor the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> expansion Tales of the
    Sword Coast are required. </p> 
  <p>This mod will not install correctly under versions of <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> below
    v200. This distribution ships with a WeiDU v200 installer, which will automatically
    update your WeiDU installer version when you install The <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Project. </p> 
  <p><acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> v12
    is not currently compatible with Tutu v6. It might install, but is guaranteed
    to behave incorrectly. Don't say we didn't warn you.</p> 
  <p>For Tutu installations, Sword Coast Stratagems, EasyTutu, and <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> (as
    well as the Tutu version of <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> Unfinished
    Business) have made special efforts to make sure players can use these mods
    together without conflict. Please visit the forums for more information.</p> 
  <p>A discussion of install order and a list of compatible mods can be found
    in <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=8122&amp;hl=">The
    Tutu State of the Modding Union</a> at the Gibberlings Three. </p> 
  <p> For <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym>, a discussion
    of install order and a list of compatible mods can be found by checking <a href="http://forums.spellholdstudios.net/index.php?showtopic=8122&amp;hl=">Spellhold
    Studios forums</a> and looking for specific install order recommendations. </p>

<h2>Known Issues</h2> 
<div class="section"> 
  <p><em>"WARNING: I_C_T2: the interjection point (_URLYLE1 29) has multiple
      exit transitions that have different actions!" </em></p> 
  <p><strong>HARMLESS:</strong> I_C_T2 multiple "errors" reported using <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> v192
    and higher. This is expected behavior. The I_C_T2 finds different actions
    at the end of replies, and let's you know. It is safe to ignore these messages.</p> 
  <p><em>"Dynaheir's Romance final cutscene never showed up!" </em></p> 
  <p><strong>HARMLESS:</strong> The romance's final cutscene plays only on Tutu
    installations, as <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym> uses
    a different approach to moving players from the end of <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> to the beginning
    of <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>. The two interpretations are mutually exclusive, so if you would like
    to see Domi's original ending to the Dynaheir Romance, please play through
    on Tutu.</p> 
  <p><em>"Drizzt goes away and never comes back in Dynaheir's Quest." </em></p> 
  <p><strong>HARMLESS:</strong> On some installs, Drizzt appears to wait until
    you have completely cleared the spawn points before deciding to reactivate.
    Hey, who are we to dictate timing to a Hero of the Realms! If you experience
    troubles, try clearing the spawn points. Visit us on the forums if he still
    is <acronym title="Missing In Action">MIA</acronym>.</p>

    This component allows <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> to
    be sent to an Inn, another location, or to wait for you when you dismiss
    them from the party. This component is not compatible with Sword Coast Strategems,
    but both mods detect each other and will not install components that conflict.
    If you would prefer to use Sword Coast Stratagems' version, install that
    version before installing <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>'s
    version. In the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> version,
    slightly different waiting places are used, and <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> will
    highly dislike being abandoned alone in dangerous areas...</p> 
  <p><strong>The <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Project: Alora's Starting Location.<br /> 
    </strong><strong>Alora </strong>will start either in her regular starting
    place or in <a href="http://www.dudleyville.com/bg1/ar4000.htm">Gullykin</a> at
    the door to the winery. Change to the join-in dialogue: If you are using
    a mod which changes Alora's pre-joining dialogue significantly (no known
    mods do at the present), please be advised that we create an entirely new
    joining dialogue file.</p> 
  <p><strong>The <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Project: Eldoth's Starting Location<br /> 
    </strong><em>Tutu Only</em><strong><br /> 
    </strong><strong>Eldoth </strong>will start either at his regular location
    or at the <a href="http://www.dudleyville.com/bg1/ar2800b.htm">Coastal Way</a> by
    the obelisk. No change to the join-in dialogue.</p> 
  <p><strong>The <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Project: Quayle's Starting Location<br /> 
    </strong><em>Tutu Only</em><strong><br /> 
    </strong><strong>Quayle</strong> will be available in either his regular
    starting location or the <a href="http://www.dudleyville.com/bg1/ar4900.htm">Nashkel
    Carnival</a> near Great Gazib. No change to the join-in dialogue.</p> 
  <p><strong>The <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Project: Tiax's Starting Location<br /> 
    </strong><em>Tutu Only</em><strong><br /> 
    </strong><strong>Tiax </strong>will start in his regular location or <a href="http://www.dudleyville.com/bg1/ar3300b.htm">Beregost</a>,
    second floor Travenhurst Manor. No change to the join-in dialogue.</p> 
  <p><strong>Jason Compton's Accelerated Banter Script<br /> 
    </strong>This component installs Jason Compton's Accelerated Banter Script,
    which basically makes banters happen more often. It is the same one as included
    with mods such as the Banter Packs for <acronym title="Baldur's Game II">BG2</acronym>,
    so if you have installed it there you don't need it again. Don't worry, the
    installer will tell you if you already have it installed.</p> 
  <p><strong>The <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Project: Make Shar-Teel Unkillable until In Party<br /> 
    </strong>This component installs a short set of changes to Shar-Teel and
    her scripts which make her unkillable until she joins the party. This allows
    both Tutu and <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym> players
    to have the duel necessary for Shar-Teel to join the party without risking
    her destruction. It is compatible with Sword Coast Stratagems' similar component. </p> 
  <p><strong>The <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Project: Bardic Reputation Adjustment<br /> 
    </strong>This component places three Bards in three inns scattered on the
    Sword Coast. Each can be hired to spread your fearsome reputation around,
    decreasing your reputation. The amount of money this costs is dependent on
    your current reputation. This allows players to manipulate reputation both
    upwards through temple donations, and downwards through the spread of rumors
    (for those of us who hate killing an innocent just to keep neutral <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> happy).</p> 
  <p><strong>The <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Project: Cloakwood areas availability in Chapter One<br /> 
    </strong>This component provides the option of opening up the first map of
    Cloakwood or all four Cloakwood maps at the start of the game. This is to
    support players who wish to pick up Coran and Faldorn earlier.</p> 
  <p><strong>The <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Project: Check for TutuFix Walking Speeds<br /> 
    </strong><em>Tutu Only</em><strong><br /> 
    </strong>This component can be used to match <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>-created
    actors/<acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> walking speeds
    to the default walking speeds if you have chosen to install TutuFix's Walking
    Speeds Component. It checks to see if Walking Speeds has modified the <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Montaron,
    and then checks each <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>-added
    creature you have installed to see if they qualify for the walking speed
    modification. If you have, it patches accordingly. If you have not installed
    TutuFix's Walking Speeds Component, no changes will be made. PLEASE NOTE:
    This component only checks <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> creatures.
    If you have added other mods, a better approach is to install the Walking
    Speeds component of TutuFix after all mods that add new quests, characters,
    or <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> have been applied.</p> 
  <p> WARNING: Tutufix's Walking Speeds component has odd effects on the Polymorph
    spell. Fixes for these odd behaviors are under development by the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> Tweaks
    team at <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/">www.gibberlings3.net</a>.</p> 
  <p><strong>The <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Project: Player-Initiated Dialogues<br /> 
    </strong>This component will give the player force-talk options for all party
    members. This will allow the <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym> to
    ask questions about an <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> and
    their past. It also has a Player-initiated string-fixer for all <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym>.
    If an <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> is starting to
    say other character's lines, or sounds odd, then speak to the character and
    let them know that their voice "sounds strange". The <acronym title="Player-Initiated Dialogues">PID</acronym> string-fixer
    will re-map the voiced lines and responses for the character, allowing you
    to continue the game. To activate the <acronym title="Player-Initiated Dialogues">PIDs</acronym> or
    string-fixer, have your character talk to the <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> in
    question. Please note: the <acronym title="Player-Initiated Dialogues">PID</acronym> must
    be installed after all other <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> components.
    If you change an installation component involving dialogue, this component
    will automatically be uninstalled, and you may have to manually re-install
    it. </p>

    <li>Additional repairs to <acronym title="Death Variables">DVs</acronym> and
      Cutscene names/objects for Xan's Quest, tp2 id of Bag of Grain</li> 
    <li><acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym>: Multiple, huge
      amounts of rewriting, testing, and adapting to get the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym> side
      to be part of the single install. Still at Beta status for <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym>,
      as we are occasionally running into <acronym title="Player-Initiated Dialogues">PID</acronym> conflicts
      with  dialogues; the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym> side
      seems to have restored almost all of these always-true timered conditions,
      so I have to go fix them one by one. It installs, works better than the
      previous ones, and has taught me a lot, but still is definitely a Beta.
      Biggest single change from Beta 2 was the moving of a number of .cre and
      item creations to use existing creature files as templates, and the addition
      of a BGT-to-Tutu item macro </li>

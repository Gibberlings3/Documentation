      <p>First time installing a mod? Check out G3's comprehensive tutorial: <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/topic/33164-a-new-player&rsquo;s-guide-to-installing-and-playing-mods/">A New Player&rsquo;s Guide to Installing and Playing Mods</a>. </p>
      <p><strong>Special Note for Siege of Dragonspear from Steam/GOG<br />
        </strong>Good Old Games (GOG) and Steam both package the additional content for Siege of Dragonspear in a method that WeiDU, the tool used to install this mod, cannot access. You must run a program called <a href="https://github.com/Argent77/A7-DlcMerger/releases">DLC Merger</a> on your SoD installation before you can install this or any other WeiDU-based mod. </p>
      <p><strong>Enhanced Editions Note</strong><br />
        The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages. </p>
      <p><strong>Windows</strong><br />
        Mur'Neth for Windows is distributed as a self-extracting archive and includes a WeiDU installer. To install, simply double-click the archive and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, the files can be extracted into your game directory using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a> or <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-mur'neth.exe</strong> and the folder<strong> mur'neth</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-mur'neth.exe</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-mur'neth.exe</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>MacOS</strong><br />
        Mur'Neth for macOS is distributed as a compressed tarball and includes a WeiDU installer.</p>
      <p>First, extract the files from the tarball into your game directory. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-mur'neth</strong>, <strong>setup-mur'neth.command</strong>, and the folder<strong> mur'neth</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-mur'neth.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-mur'neth.command</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>Linux</strong><br />
        Mur'Neth for Linux is distributed as a compressed tarball and does not include a WeiDU installer. Linux users will need to do a one-time install of <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility"><abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr></abbr> (and a few other adjustments) as described in <a href="https://moebiusproject.gitlab.io/mods_on_linux" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">this great writeup</a>. </p>
      <p>To install, run 'WeInstall mur'neth' in your game folder. </p>
      <p><strong> Note for Complete Uninstallation</strong><br />
        In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely uninstall the mod using setup-mur'neth --uninstall at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts. </p>

    </div>
    <div class="ribbon_triangle_h2-l"></div>
    <div class="ribbon_triangle_h2-r"></div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>This mod contains two components. The first is the joinable <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Mur'Neth. Though it was planned as a One - Day <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> inspired by the <a href="http://www.pocketplane.net/oneday">Pocket Plane Group</a>, since the initial version a lot more content has been added and it has as much as, or more than, any other <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym>. The second is an option to replace the rare selection sounds with common ones.</p>
      <p><strong>Mur'Neth</strong><br />
        This component adds the new <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> to the game. Mur'Neth can be found inside the Nashkel Mines on the penultimate floor, near a pool of water in the bottom - left corner of the map. He is a Ghaunadan, a member of the race of ooze - like shapechangers who venerate Ghaunadaur, the evil deity of oozes, moulds and the like. He is of Chaotic Evil alignment and has the following statistics:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><acronym title="Strength">STR</acronym>: 17 </li>
        <li><acronym title="Dexterity">DEX</acronym>: 16</li>
        <li><acronym title="Constitution">CON</acronym>: 16</li>
        <li><acronym title="Intelligence">INT</acronym>: 11</li>
        <li><acronym title="Wisdom">WIS</acronym>: 10</li>
        <li><acronym title="Charisma">CHR</acronym>: 14</li>
      </ul>
      <p>He has a unique kit, based on the thief class. When encountered he is Level 3 with no particular bias in skills. His proficiencies are in club and dagger and he has a small amount of equipment. The kit is as follows:</p>
      <div class="kit_description">
        <p>GHAUNADAN: These vile, intelligent monsters are the loyal servants of Ghaunadaur, the evil deity venerated by oozes, slimes, jellies and some drow. Ghaunadans are similar to oozes, but they are quite intelligent and can form their bodies into the shape of an attractive humanoid. In its natural form, a ghaunadan resembles an ooze-like creature such as an ochre jelly or green slime. Ghaunadans lack many of the advantages of thieves, but make up for these with unique abilities of their own, such as their charming gaze and unique resistances.</p>
        <p>Advantages: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>May cast Friends once per day per 2 levels.</li>
          <li>Immune to blindness, poison, disease, sleep, paralysis and stunning. In addition, they have 10% resistance to bludgeoning damage.</li>
          <li>Can make an Ooze Touch attack once per day per 3 levels. This ability lasts for 5 rounds. The attack does <acronym title="1 roll of a 6-sided die">1d6</acronym> damage and the target must save vs. poison or be held for 5 rounds.</li>
          <li>Can shapeshift between ooze and human forms once per day per 5 levels. While in ooze form, all the character's attacks are paralytic. There is no limit to the time spent in either form.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Disadvantages: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Only gets 15 skill points per level.</li>
          <li>Cannot set traps.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>His biography is as follows:</p>
      <p>When you ask about his past, MUR'NETH turns towards you and lets out a long, tortured gurgle. Although his true form is that of an ooze, he seems comfortable being referred to as a male.</p>
      <p>You glean from his words a deep devotion to his deity Ghaunadaur, creator of his race. Mur'Neth reveals this is typical for his kind - they truly live to serve him. Mur'Neth was spawned only recently to investigate the tainting of the ores beneath the Nashkel Mines, which has resulted in the deaths of many of the native oozes and moulds in the area. This displeased Ghaunadaur greatly, though he seems content to permit Mur'Neth to accompany you for now...</p>
      <p><strong>Remove Rare Select Sounds</strong><br />
        <em>Requires Mur'Neth, only for BGT or Tutu games</em></p>
      <p> The NPCs in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> had rare select sounds, but the way <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> works these aren't so rare when playing Tutu. Tutu <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> have an option to replace these rare selection sounds with common ones from their soundset. So at Ghreyfain's request, I've done this for Mur'Neth too. Obviously, it requires that the first component be installed...</p>

Thank you to icelus, TheWizard and Michel/Shodan for mirroring the <acronym title="The Gibberlings Three">G3</acronym> mods. Big thanks to Sol Ek Sa for providing artwork for the mod - Ana (aka Immortality) for the recolor of the portrait and Khayman for the new icons for Ooze Touch in both forms.

Finally, thanks to the Arch - Fiend Jason Compton for providing voicing for Mur'Neth. It took a while to bug him to do it, but it took me longer to get round to using it!</p>

      <p><strong>Version 14 - November 1, 2023</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed broken check for Garrick in one dialogue (thanks TotoR)</li>
        <li>Mur'Neth comes with two rare selection sounds, like a normal Baldur's Gate NPC. Unfortunately these weren't really handled well, and various issues have been addressed:
          <ul>
            <li>On BGEE, these were slotted wrong and action sounds were played as rare selection sounds. The action and rare selection sounds now play properly. </li>
            <li>On EET the rare selection sounds were being played as rare action sounds. This is fixed. </li>
            <li>Tutu and BGT, like EET, played rare selection sounds as rare action sounds. Unlike EET these can only be fixed if <em>Mixed Soundset</em> support from <strong><a href="https://github.com/SpellholdStudios/TobEx_AfterLife/">TobEx AfterLife</a></strong> is installed first. If this is detected, the sounds will be adjusted to work properly. If <strong>TobEx AfterLife</strong> is not unavailable, the <strong>Remove Rare Select Sounds</strong> component can be used to work around the issue.</li>

        <li> Removed the save penalty from Ooze Touch as it was a little too powerful for <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym></li>
        <li> Added AoE compatibility for the kit</li>
        <li> Boosted stats a little - as whenever I actually tried to use him in a game, he got completely slaughtered!</li>

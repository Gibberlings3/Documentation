      <p> Project Javelin introduces a new class of weaponry to the game in the form of javelins: one-handed spears that can be throw or used in melee. They use the existing spear proficiency,  providing a boost to a somewhat neglected class of weapons. </p>

      <p>Project Javelin is designed for any BG2-based Infinity Engine game. This includes the original Baldur's Gate II, the conversion projects BGT and Tutu, and all of the Enhanced Editions of Baldur's Gate, Baldur's Gate II, Icewind Dale, and the BG2EE-based EET conversion project. </p>
      <p>At present there are no known incompatibilities. The components from IWDification and RoyalProtector's Tweaks that increase the base damage of spears will work on Project Javelin and they can be installed in any order. </p>
      <p>In terms of install order; Project Javelin does try to modify existing stores and areas to scatter javelins throughout the game. Ideally this means Project Javelin should follow item and quest mods but does not necessarily need to be installed late in the process like a tweak mod. </p>

      <ul>
        <li>The weapon animations (melee and thrown) were adapted, pixel by pixel, from existing animations. Unfortunately the quality of my One Braincell Productions is not the match of the artistry and professionalism of One Pixel Productions, so despite my best efforts expect some jank. Improving the animations will be an ongoing effort. </li>

        Good Old Games (<abbr title="Good Old Games">GOG</abbr>) and Steam both package the additional content for Siege of Dragonspear in a method that <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr>, the tool used to install this mod, cannot access. You must run a program called <a href="https://github.com/Argent77/A7-DlcMerger/releases"><abbr title="Downloadable Content">DLC</abbr> Merger</a> on your <abbr title="Siege of Dragonspear">SoD</abbr> installation before you can install this or any other <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr>-based mod. </p>

        The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game&#39;s folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages. </p>

        Project Javelin for Windows is distributed as a self-extracting archive and includes a <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr> installer. To install, simply double-click the archive and follow the instructions on screen. </p>
      <p> Alternatively, the files can be extracted into your game directory using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a> or <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-cd_project_javelin.exe</strong> and the folder <strong>cd_project_javelin</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-cd_project_javelin.exe</strong> and follow the instructions on screen. </p>
      <p> You can run <strong>setup-cd_project_javelin.exe</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components. </p>

        Project Javelin for macOS is distributed as a compressed tarball and includes a <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr> installer. </p>
      <p> First, extract the files from the tarball into your game directory. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-cd_project_javelin</strong>, <strong>setup-cd_project_javelin.command</strong>, and the folder <strong>cd_project_javelin</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-cd_project_javelin.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen. </p>

        Project Javelin for Linux is distributed as a compressed tarball and does not include a <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr> installer. Linux users will need to do a one-time install of <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr> (and a few other adjustments) as described in <a href="https://moebiusproject.gitlab.io/mods_on_linux">this great writeup</a>. </p>
      <p> To install, run &#39;WeInstall cd_project_javelin in your game folder. </p>

        In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely uninstall the mod using setup-cd_project_javelin --uninstall at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts. </p>

      <p>Basic, unenchanted javelins have the following stats:</p>
      <div class="kit_description">
        <p>Javelins are light, flexible spears designed primarily as a throwing weapon. They are usually constructed of wood and tipped with a small metal spearhead. The shaft is much thinner than a two-handed spear. The javelin is a ranged weapon, intended to be thrown. While javelins can be used for melee combat, they are not sturdy enough and perform poorly.</p>
        <p>STATISTICS:</p>
        <p>Damage: 1d6 (thrown, missile)<br />
          Damage: 1d4 (melee, piercing)<br />
          Speed Factor: 4<br />
          Proficiency Type: Spear<br />
          Type: One-handed<br />
          Requires:<br />
          5 Strength</p>
        <p>Weight: 3</p>
      </div>
      <p>Note that all javelins can be used as a thrown or melee weapon, but by design the melee damage is inferior&mdash;these are meant to be primarily ranged weapons. In addition to basic javelins, magical javelins are also added to the game and a <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/topic/39784-g3-welcomes-project-javelin/#findComment-350748">complete, spoilered list</a> of their locations is available on the G3 forums. </p>

      <p>First a huge thank you to Lava who provided all of the item icons. They look fantastic and he even provided them knowing full well I was distracting myself from working on <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/mods/quests/thecalling/">The Calling</a> instead... Lava also provided inspiration for a couple of the items, so thanks for that as well. </p>
      <p>As part of the <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/mods/items/g3cip/">G3 Community Item Pack</a>, I made an upgradeable javelin so that we could use it as an exercise to learn about projectiles, upgrades, and making item icons. However, as the idea rolled around my head I thought it could be a new weapon class instead of a one-off, and Project Javelin was created. The aforementioned javelin, the Evergreen Javelin, has joined the mod as the Evergreen Lance and has been fully realized. </p>
      <p>This was more or less a nice weekend project... until I realized the weapons themselves weren't animating. At minimum, trying to make  one-handed spear animations doubled (at a <em>minimum</em>) the work. However I think&mdash;maybe hope!&mdash;I've accomplished passable animations. Slogging through the animations has given me an even deeper appreciation of One Pixel Productions and Erephine's amazing work. </p>

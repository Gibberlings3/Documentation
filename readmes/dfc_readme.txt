+) Section 1. About
===================
  Dat File Converter (dfc) is a small tool to convert the .dat files used by DLTCEP/IEEP etc to plain text file, prserving only the opcode names. The resultant list can then be printed, and used as a cheat-sheet, or summary sheet for the effects available in the game. The converter works with the .dat files for BG1, BG2, PST, IWD1 and IWD2 (in fact the converter works for all files using the .dat format).

+) Section 2. (un)Installation
==============================
To install DFC simply unzip DFC(xx).zip (where (xx) represents the version of DFC). Popular unzipping tools include Winzip (http://www.winzip.com/) and Filzip (http://www.filzip.com/). Once the files are extracted you can place them wherever you like. Files included in the distribution are:
  readme.txt - this file
  dfc.exe - the dcf executable

To uninstall DFC just delete the files you extracted from dfc[xx].zip. The DFC distribution includes no external dll files, and creates no registry entries.

+) Section 3. Usage
===================
DFC runs as a console application, so there is not much of a GUI. The 2 ways of running DFC are:
  i) Interactive (not included in this version)
    Just run (double-click) DFC in Windows Explorer.

  ii) Command-line
    DFC can be run from the command-line (shortcut, run dialog, DOS box, batch file). Usage in this mode is:
      DFC [alpha|numeric] input.ext output.ext
    
    Using the alpha parameter will sort the resultant file alphabetically.
    Using the numeric parameter will sort the resultant file by opcode.

                Ascension's version of Chapter 10 can be broken into four stages.
                <p><strong>Stage 1: Irenicus, Bodhi, Imoen</strong></p>
                <p>
                    In the first stage of Chapter 10, Melissan summons Irenicus back from death, and he in turn calls up
                    Bodhi. Melissan also brings out the Bhaalspawn taint in Imoen, turning her into the slayer. (Unlike
                    the unmodded game, Melissan then re-enters the energy stream, and will not emerge till later.) You have the chance to persuade
                    Bodhi to join your side by promising her a part of your soul: to do so, you need to have a non-good
                    alignment, a reputation of 11 or below, and a Charisma of 16 or more; you also cannot have recruited
                    Balthazar. (If you have a Wisdom of 16 or more, you can trick Bodhi and only pretend to promise part
                    of your soul; this has no effect on gameplay but allows you to betray her in the epilogue.)</p>
                <p>In the ensuing fight, Irenicus is supported by Fallen Solars, with the number depending on the
                    difficulty and whether you recruit Balthazar or Bodhi. The maximum number of Solars is 3 (if you
                    recruit Bodhi and are on INSANE difficulty).</p>
                <p>Imoen is unkillable for the first three rounds of the combat, but thereafter can be killed normally.
                    She will return to normal either after 10 rounds or after all other opponents are removed, and then
                    will offer to rejoin the party if she was previously in it.</p>
                <p><strong>Stage 2: Pools, Demons</strong></p>
                <p>
                    With Irenicus defeated once more, you have to still all three essence pools in order to draw
                    Melissan out. Each pool can be activated by either the player or Imoen (anyone else trying to
                    activate it will take damage). Initially, activating the pool just causes a large group of demons to
                    teleport in. Once the demons are dead, touching the pool again drains its essence, and also grants
                    new powers to the Bhaalspawn touching it (who, note, can be either Imoen or the player). Full
                    descriptions of the powers gained can be found <a href="#pool_powers">here</a> and is also
                    documented in-game, either by right-clicking on the new abilities (Enhanced Edition) or as a journal
                    entry (non-Enhanced Edition).</p>
                <p>
                    Touching the pool also applies a Greater Restoration effect to the whole party, and sometimes also
                    rests the party so that they can regain all spells and abilities. This rest effect is controlled by
                    the difficulty:
                    <ul>
                        <li>INSANE: you never get to regain spells and abilities</li>
                        <li>HARD: you regain spells and abilities after the last pool</li>
                        <li>CORE: you regain spells and abilities after the first and last pools</li>
                        <li>NORMAL/EASY: you regain spells and abilities after each pool</li>
                    </ul>
                    After the last pool has been stilled, you have only about fifteen seconds before Melissan appears
                    and Stage 3 starts.</li>
                </p>
                <p><strong>The Five</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Melissan reappears, and summons the Five. If Balthazar is in the party, of course he is not
                    summoned, but Melissan will instead summon Gromnir if the difficulty is CORE or higher.
                </p>
                <p>In addition, Melissan will make a play for Sarevok's loyalty. If he is in the party, she will try to
                    recruit him. She always fails if Sarevok has been redeemed (i.e., is now Chaotic Good); she also
                    fails on difficulty EASY, NORMAL or CORE. On HARD or INSANE difficulty, Sarevok will betray you
                    unless you are evil and have a Reputation of 9 or lower.</p>
                <p>If Sarevok is not in the party, and has not previously been redeemed, Melissan will summon him if the
                    difficulty is CORE or higher, and he will side with her. If he has been redeemed (but is no longer
                    in the party), she will summon him but he will side with you. (In this situation, he functions as a
                    non-party ally, just as with Balthazar; his AI can be toggled on and off with the E key.)</p>
                <p>Melissan then departs and leaves you to fight the Five. Their baseline abilities are the same as in
                    the Tougher components, though they are more sensitive to the difficulty slider; details can be
                    found <a href="#abilities_immunities_the_five">here</a>.</p>
                <p>This phase continues until Melissan's return, which is keyed to the difficulty slider and to how many of
                    the Five you defeat (with Sarevok and Grommir included, and with Illasera, Sendai and Balthazar
                    counting double). The details are as follows:
                    <ul>
                        <li>INSANE: Melissan appears as soon as any of the Five are killed</li>
                        <li>HARD: Melissan appears once you kill any two of the Five (or any one of Sendai, Illasera or
                            Balthazar)</li>
                        <li>CORE: Melissan appears once you kill any three of the Five (or any two, including Sendai,
                            Illasera or Balthazar)</li>
                        <li>NORMAL or EASY: Melissan appears once you kill any four of the Five, with Sendai, Illasera
                            and Balthazar counting double</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p><strong>Melissan and the Five</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Once Melissan appears, she will fight you alongside the Five (and alongside demons which she
                    periodically summons). She is immortal until they are all defeated: as long as any of them remain,
                    reducing her hit points to zero will just cause her to retreat to the essence stream to heal. Each
                    time one of the Five is slain, she is weakened, taking damage and losing some of her protective
                    abilities. A more detailed description of Melissan's abilities and immunities can be found <a
                        href="#melissan_details">here</a>.</p>
                </p>

            <div class="section">

                <p><strong>Summoning and controlling demons</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Melissan can gate in demons; each use of Gate summons 2 Cambions, a Succubus, and an Alu-fiend (1/3
                    of the time), a Babau and a Nabassu (1/3), a Marilith (1/9), a Glabrezu (1/9),
                    or a Balor (1/9). She uses this gate ability up to once per 4 rounds on INSANE difficulty, once per
                    5 rounds on HARD difficulty, and once per 6 rounds on CORE difficulty, though she will not do so if
                    too many enemies are already present.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once the Five are all defeated, a desperate (or enraged!) Melissan will step up her demon summoning.
                    To begin with, she triggers a contingency effect which applies Gate on Core difficulty, three Gates
                    on Hard difficulty, and five Gates at once on Insane difficulty. Thereafter, she summons at the rate
                    of once per 3 rounds on INSANE, 4 rounds on HARD, 5 rounds on CORE and 6 rounds on NORMAL.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On INSANE, Melissan has a single use of another powerful summoning spell, which calls up two Fallen
                    Solars.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On any difficulty, Melissan has the ability to control demons, specifically those controlled by or
                    summoned by the party. She can use this power at will, entering into a brief period of mental battle
                    at the end of which the demon is either controlled (75%) or punished by a blast of divine energy
                    (25%). On difficulty CORE or higher, she has a one-off chance to take control of every demon on the
                    battlefield in a similar manner.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Melissan's immunities</strong></p>
                <p>
                    At her full power, Melissan has a powerful suite of immunities and protections:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Immunity to stun effects, paralysis, sleep, charm and domination, Imprisonment, Maze,
                            disintegration, polymorph, poison, level drain, Intelligence drain, and confusion</li>
                        <li>Immunity to Timestop</li>
                        <li>Immunity to backstab effects</li>
                        <li>Immunity to all first-to-fourth level spells</li>
                        <li>Immunity to any weapon of less than +5 enchantment</li>
                        <li>95% resistance to fire and electrical damage</li>
                        <li>50% resistance to cold and acid damage</li>
                        <li>95% resistance to magical damage</li>
                        <li>90% resistance to all physical damage</li>
                        <li>95% magic resistance</li>
                        </li>2/3 chance that any spell she casts is uninterruptable</li>
                        <li>1,000 hit points</li>
                    </ul>
                    However, for each of the Five who are killed, Melissan's defenses weaken, as follows:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Abazigal killed: -100 hit points; electrical resistance drops to 50%, can be affected to +3
                            and +4 weapons</li>
                        <li>Balthazar (or Gromnir) killed: -100 hit points; physical damage resistance drops to 75%;
                            vulnerable to backstabs (Melissan also receives this penalty if neither Balthazar nor
                            Gromnir fights for her in the first place)</li>
                        <li>Illasera killed: -100 hit points; magic damage resistance reduced to 50%</li>
                        <li>Sendai killed: -100 hit points; magic resistance drops to 70%; can be affected by third and
                            fourth level spells; -4 penalty to saves vs. spells</li>
                        <li>Yaga-Shura killed: -100 hit points; fire resistance reduced to 50%; -2 penalty to saves vs.
                            death</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    As long as any of the Five (or Gromnir, or Sarevok) live and fight for Melissan, she cannot be
                    killed: if reduced to below 20 hp she retreats to the energy stream to recharge.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Melissan's protective spells</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Melissan has five powerful defensive and restorative spells. Divine Mantle is effectively a priestly
                    version of Absolute Immunity, giving immunity to weapons below +6. Divine Spell Shield is a priestly
                    version of Spell Trap which additionally reflects 10 levels of level 1-3 spells. Divine Restoration
                    is a combined Greater Restoration and Negative Plane Protection - but using it reduces Melissan's
                    Strength by 1 for 120 seconds and inflicts 100 points of magic damage on her. Divine Cleansing is a
                    self-only ability that wipes essentially all negative effects on Melissan, at the cost of a
                    25-hit-point reduction and a short moment of paralysis. And Blade Barrier is a powerful variant of
                    the normal cleric spell that does 12d12 damage to anyone caught in it.
                </p>
                <p>Melissan's use of these abilities depends on the difficulty slider. She begins combat with Divine
                    Mantle and Divine Spell Shield cast, and then gets to recast them after 5 rounds. After that, the
                    pattern looks like this:
                    <ul>
                        <li>EASY: no divine restoration; no blade barrier; divine cleansing usable once only; divine
                            spell shield not further renewable; divine mantle renewable once per 20 rounds.</li>
                        <li>NORMAL: divine restoration at will; blade barrier and divine cleansing usable once per 20
                            rounds; divine mantle renewable once per 10 rounds; divine spell shield renewable once per
                            20 rounds.</li>
                        <li>CORE: divine restoration at will; blade barrier and divine cleansing usable once per 10
                            rounds; divine mantle renewable once per 5 rounds; divine spell shield renewable once per 10
                            rounds.</li>
                        <li>HARD or INSANE: divine restoration at will; other powers usable once per 5 rounds.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p><strong>Time Stop</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Melissan can use Time Stop, with a frequency dependent on the difficulty: on EASY difficulty she
                    does not use it at all; on NORMAL difficulty she uses it once; on CORE difficulty, once per 30
                    rounds; on HARD or INSANE difficulty, once per 20 rounds.</p>
                <p>In addition, on NORMAL difficulty or above she receives an additional use of Time Stop after the Five
                    are all defeated.</li>
                </p>
                <p><strong>Melissan in close combat</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Melissan's +6 spear inflicts slashing damage, destroys undead, damages demons, and dispels
                    illusions. Successful hits inflict 2d10 cold damage (save vs. spell at -4 for 1/2 and reduce the
                    target's saving throws by 1 point for 2 rounds. 15% of hits also stun the target for 3 rounds.</p>
                <p>Melissan also gains the following close-combat abilities:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Unleash: usable once per 3 rounds as a close-range area of effect (on difficulty CORE and
                            higher), or at will as a single-target attack (on difficulty NORMAL and higher). Victims
                            take 8d12 magic damage, are knocked back, and are rendered unconscious for a few seconds (a
                            save vs. death at -4 halves the damage and negates all other effects). Using Unleash
                            temporarily (i.e., for two rounds) weakens Melissan, reducing her number of attacks by 1,
                            her movement by 50%, and her Strength by 3.</li>
                        <li>Greater Whirlwind (as the fighter High-Level Ability): usable once per 5 rounds on HARD or
                            INSANE, once per 10 rounds on CORE, once on NORMAL and not at all on EASY.</li>
                        <li>A knockback blow with minor damage, usable once per 2.5 rounds on all difficulty settings.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Melissan's spells</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Melissan can cast the following spells on all difficulty settings: True Sight (at will), Breach
                        (once per 3 rounds), Pierce Shield (once per 3 rounds), Bigby's Crushing Hand (once), Finger of
                        Death (once per 3 rounds). On NORMAL and higher, she can use Power Word, Kill once per 20
                        rounds; on CORE and higher, she can use Unholy Word once per 5 rounds.
                    </p>
                    <p>On HARD or INSANE difficulty, Melissan receives one use of each of the following three high-level
                        abilities (but can only use an ability from this list every 2 rounds): Comet, Dragon's Breath,
                        Storm of Vengeance.</p>
                    <p>Melissan also has these unique abilities:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Symbol of Slow: a symbol effect, that slows its targets for 2 rounds unless they save
                                vs. spell at a -4 penalty. Usable once per 5 rounds, at any difficulty.</li>
                            <li>Bone Blades, a cage of blades placed around a victim that freezes them in place for a
                                few seconds, taking 10d6 piercing and 10d6 slashing damage over that period (save vs.
                                paralysation at -4 for half damage). Afterwards the victim is slowed for the rest of the
                                round and takes a -2 penalty to Dexterity for 5 rounds (save vs. paralysis at -2 to
                                avoid). Bone Blades is usable once per 2 rounds on HARD or INSANE difficulty, once per 3
                                rounds on CORE difficulty, once per 5 rounds on NORMAL difficulty, and once per 10
                                rounds on EASY difficulty.</li>
                            <li>Banishment, a variant of Death Spell used to destroy summons, usable at will on all
                                difficulties.</li>
                        </ul>

            <div class="section">
                <p>Gromnir is included among the Five; Sarevok is not. These notes apply to both incarnations of the
                    Five, unless specifically noted.</p>
                <p><strong>Shared immunities</p></strong>
                <p>All of the Five are immune to charm, fear, petrification, polymorph, death magic, disintegration,
                    poison, and the intelligence drain ability of mind flayers, and can see through invisibility. When
                    they are originally encountered, they are in addition immune to stun, paralysation, energy drain,
                    imprisonment, and Sarevok's Deathbringer attack; they lose these immunities in Chapter 10 (except
                    that Abazigal retains his immunity to Imprisonment).</p>
                <p><strong>Abazigal</strong></p>
                <p>In human form, Abazigal is a 30th level fighter with immunity to electricity, 80% resistance to
                    missile damage, and 65% magic resistance; when you first encounter him he is also immune to Time
                    Stop, though he loses this when Melissan resurrects him. He fights with Gram, the Sword of Grief,
                    which is a +5 two-handed sword, but in Abazigal's hands its poison ability is suppressed, and
                    replaced by a 15% chance of draining 3hp, a 10% chance of draining 6hp, and a 75% chance of
                    inflicting one point of electrical damage. He can use Kai five times, Hardiness once and Whirlwind
                    Attack twice. (In Chapter 10, he does not use Kai on EASY difficulty, and does not use Hardiness or
                    Whirlwind Attack on EASY or NORMAL difficulty.)</p>
                <p>In dragon form, Abazigal is immune to Timestop and has the usual dragon abilities, including a
                    lightning breath weapon which inflicts 24d10 damage, save vs. breath for 1/2. He has 127% resistance
                    to electricity, 40% resistance to other forms of elemental damage, 65% resistance to magic damage,
                    and 50% resistance to physical damage. In addition, he has several unique powers:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Shockwave (dragon-form version, used once per 3.5 rounds): Everyone in the area takes 4d10
                            electrical damage (save vs. spell at -4 for half damage) and must save vs breath weapon at
                            -4 or suffer 90% casting failure for 2 rounds, vs. spell at -6 or be knocked unconscious for
                            3 seconds.</li>
                        <li>Shockwave (human-form version, used only in Chapter 10): A chain-lightning effect,
                            inflicting 6d10 electrical damage (save vs. spells at -2 for half) and 5d6 magical damage
                            (no saving throw) and inflicting a -2 AC penalty for 5 rounds. This effect 'inflicts' 5d6
                            electrical damage upon Abazigal, but this effectively heals him slightly. Used on CORE, HARD
                            or INSANE difficulty. Used once per 3 rounds on HARD or INSANE difficulty, once per 5 rounds
                            on CORE difficulty, and not used on EASY or NORMAL difficulty.</li>
                        </li>
                        <li>Tail Slap (dragon form only, once per 5 rounds): functionally equivalent to Earthquake.</li>
                        <li>Lightning Aura: knocks enemies back, inflicts 6d6 electrical damage (save vs spells at -2
                            for half) and 3d6 magic damage (no save), with the magic damage being drained to Abazigal
                            and healing him. Used once per 3 rounds on HARD or INSANE difficulty, once per 5 rounds on
                            CORE difficulty, and not used on EASY or NORMAL difficulty.</li>
                    </ul>
                    In either form, Abazigal is a powerful spellcaster, with defensive contingencies and triggers,
                    though in Chapter 10 these are fully used only on difficulty HARD or INSANE, and are not used at all
                    on EASY difficulty.</p>
                <p><strong>Balthazar</strong></p>
                <p>Balthazar has Free Action; he is initially 90% resistant to magic, magic damage, and elemental
                    damage, and 10% resistant to physical damage, but he can swap the two at will. His various special
                    abilities are fully detailed <a href="#balthazar_abilities">here</a>. In chapter 10, a hostile
                    Balthazar will avoid using some abilities on easier difficulty settings: on EASY, he doesn't use
                    Shadow Stance, Second Wind, Dragon Fist, or Hand of Murder; on NORMAL, he doesn't use Second Wind or
                    Dragon Fist; on CORE, he doesn't use Second Wind.</p>
                <p><strong>Gromnir</strong></p>
                <p>Gromnir has immunity to disease, 50% magic damage resistance, 25% magic resistance, and 25%
                    resistance to physical damage. He can use Berserker Rage twice, Hardiness twice, and Whirlwind three
                    times. In chapter 10, he uses Berserker Rage only on NORMAL difficulty and up, and his other powers
                    only on CORE difficulty and up.</p>
                <p>Gromnir wields the mace Ice Star (a +4 mace granting 20% fire resistance and +4 cold damage); in his
                    hands, the mace is imbued with magical-disease-causing powers, inflicting a two-round-duration
                    slowing disease on an enemy who fails a save vs. poison at -4, and a wasting disease (3 hp damage
                    per second for ten rounds) on an enemy who fails to save at -6. 25% of hits also inflict a
                    strength-draining disease, causing the victim to lose one point of Strength for 10 rounds (save vs.
                    poison at -2 to negate).</p>
                <p><strong>Illasera</strong></p>
                <p>Illasera is an 18th level ranger, with 50% magic resistance. She has several unique arrows:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Disrupting arrows: destroy illusions, banish summoned creatures, remove all magical effects,
                            inflict a 40% casting failure for 3 rounds, and reduce Magic Resistance by 5% for 5 rounds.
                        </li>
                        <li>Debilitating arrows: drain 10 hp from the target (gained by Illasera), stun the victim for 2
                            rounds with an additional 2 rounds of slowing (save vs. polymorph at -4 to avoid).</li>
                        <li>Knockback arrows: 2d10 magic damage, knocked back, 2 seconds of unconsciousness, and a -1
                            THAC0 penalty for 5 rounds (save vs. paralysis at -4 to half the damage and negate all other
                            effects).</li>
                    </ul>
                    In Chapter 10, Illasera mostly refrains from using her disrupting arrows on EASY and NORMAL
                    difficulty.</p>
                <p>
                    Illasera has a powerful defensive ability, Ethereality, which she can use once per 4 rounds on CORE
                    difficulty or higher, once per 5 rounds on NORMAL difficulty, and once per 8 rounds on EASY
                    difficulty. For the first round of her ethereality, she is invisible and immune to most forms of
                    attack; for the remaning two rounds sh is improved-invisible, immune to divination, gains 50%
                    physical damage resistance, and gets +4 to AC. On NORMAL difficulty and higher, while ethereal she
                    may cast Cure Critical Wounds once per round.</p>
                <p><strong>Sendai</strong></p>
                <p>(These notes apply only to the chapter 10 version of Sendai: Ascension doesn't offer a tougher
                    version of the original Sendai.)</p>
                <p>Sendai is a 20th/20th level cleric/mage, with innate (drow) magic resistance of 84% and a 4-point
                    bonus to casting speed. She wears a ring that she can use to teleport across the battlefield once
                    per round (which she uses on difficulty CORE+) and carries scrolls of Improved Alacrity (used only
                    on difficulty CORE+), Greater Restoration, and Freedom, as well as a potion of Heal. In combat she
                    uses a +6 flail: one quarter of hits slow the target for 30 seconds and reduce their Strength to 3
                    for 10 seconds (save vs. spell at -2 to avoid the former, save vs spell to avoid the latter).
                    Remaining hits poison the target for 10 seconds (save vs. breath to avoid).</p>
                <p>Sendai's use of her spells is tied to the difficulty slider. On CORE, she does not use Implosion; on
                    NORMAL, she also does not use Time Stop, Creeping Doom, Harm, her Improved Alacrity scroll, and her
                    initial Spell Sequencer; on EASY, she also does not use Power Word Kill or her initial Spell
                    Sequencer, and will not attempt to recover Imprisoned allies. </p>
                <p><strong>Yaga-Shura</strong></p>
                <p>Yaga-Shura begins with 127% resistance to fire, 50% resistance to cold, and 99% resistance to all
                    other forms of damage. If Nyalee's ritual has been performed, he loses these resistances (except
                    fire) at a rate of 2% per round, until he has lost a total of 30% (so that he has 20% resistance to
                    cold, 127% resistance to fire, and 70% resistance to everything else). In Chapter 10, he retains
                    this behaviour on HARD difficulty or higher; on CORE, NORMAL or EASY, he begins at his 'final'
                    resistance.</p>
                <p>Yaga-Shura can cast Fire Storm once per encounter, Sunray once per five rounds, and Aura of Flaming
                    Death once per 10 rounds. Once per five rounds, he can call down a Lava Bomb over a wide area, which
                    inflicts 1d10 crushing damage and 8d10 (save vs. breath for 1/2) fire damage. Anyone affected is
                    knocked back and must save vs. paralysation at -10 or be rendered unconscious for a few seconds. In
                    Chapter 10, Yaga-Shura uses Lava Bombs only on CORE difficulty and above, and does not use his other
                    spell-like abilities on EASY.</p>
                <p>Yaga-Shura dual-wields two hammers: a Runehammer +4 (which can be resized for use by the party) and
                    an unnamed +5 hammer too large for humans to use. Blows from this weapon have a 50% chance of dazing
                    the target for three rounds: dazed party members are slowed and suffer a -1 penalty to Strength and
                    Constitution. 10% of hits are with such force that the target is flung backwards and knocked
                    momentarily unconscious.</p>

                    First, the bottom line on your chance of success:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Any good-aligned character has the potential to recruit Balthazar.</li>
                        <li>A neutral-aligned character can recruit Balthazar provided they have at least one of:
                            Reputation 19+; Wisdom 16+; Charisma 16+.</li>
                        <li>There is a very narrow path by which an evil character with Wisdom 19+ can recruit
                            Balthazar. Evil characters with lower wisdom cannot recruit him, but may be able to convince
                            him to commit ritual suicide rather than fighting.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whether you <em>actually</em> recruit him is another matter: there are many different routes through
                    the conversation, and in only some can you gain his trust. In general, the following things help:
                    Good alignment, high (19+) reputation, high (16+) Wisdom or Charisma. Having a Wisdom of 19+ is even
                    better. The more of these things you have, the more safety margin you have; with few of them, the
                    path to success is quite narrow.</p>
                <p>
                    Some hints:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Balthazar is Lawful Good, yet his mercenaries and monks are not behaving like the servants
                            of a Lawful Good ruler. Balthazar is pretty guilty about this, and any character can use
                            this to influence him.</li>
                        <li>Sufficiently heroic characters can point out their own heroism and shame Balthazar into
                            following suit.</li>
                        <li>Sufficiently charismatic characters can persuade Balthazar that there are other options he
                            hasn't considered.</li>
                        <li>Wise characters can point out factual information Balthazar is unaware of or ignoring: most
                            importantly, the true nature of the prophecy of Alaundo as revealed by the Solar, and
                            Melissan's true plans.</li>

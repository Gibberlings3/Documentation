<h3><a name="general" id="general"></a> I. ABOUT THE MOD </h3>
<blockquote>
  <p><i>Baldur's Gate, Nashkell Carnival: The Great Gazib, embarrassed stoned
    maidens and Lord Binky the Buffoon.</i></p>
  <p><i> Baldur's Gate II, Waukeen's Promenade Circus: Kala, depressed ogre maidens,
    wolfweres, shades and darkness.</i></p>
  <p><i>Somewhere along the way, we stopped having fun.</i></p>
  <p>Every Mod and Dog (EMaD) is a WeiDU-based mod that adds a selection of
    small diversions and sidequests to Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn, with the expansion Throne of Bhaal, or to the new Enhanced Edition, or the conversion projects BGT or EET. Its
    major aim is to recapture some of the more buoyant and adventurous spirit
    that was found in the original Baldur's Gate. </p>
  <p>None of the components included in this mod will
    interfere directly with the original game's main plot and all quests are
    optional. Some of the quests were inspired by the various &quot;Iron
    Modder&quot; competition themes at the Pocket Plane Group. </p>
  <p>The following components are included
    in the current version of this mod: </p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a
  name="zrater" id="zrater"></a>A. A Z-rated Adventure </h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Originally begun as an attempt to practise Iron
    modding, this component developed into something rather.. buggy. You meet a
    woman with a bad hair day and a shocking problem in the Umar Hills
    wilderness. Help her, and you'll gain a small and quite irritating friend. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a
  name="Tegenk" id="Tegenk"></a>B. The Promise of a Troll </h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>The Iron Modder 4 contest revolved around the theme
    'A Broken Promise'. This component introduces the lovelorn troll, Tegenk,
    whose happiness depends on whether or not you can help him keep his promise.
    You can find Tegenk in the wilderness in the Druid's Grove. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a
  name="bestfriend" id="bestfriend"></a>C. A Bhaalspawn's Best Friend </h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Sometimes it just seems as if the world is against
    you. You've had a tiff with your lover, your childhood best buddy is
    festering in a cell and you've just had yet another altercation with a
    thief/vampire/pirate intent on slitting your throat. Sometimes a Bhaalspawn
    just needs a healthy dose of unconditional love. This component introduces a
    stray wolf who seems to like following you around. He's quiet, undemanding,
    and no toilet-training is required. He can be found hiding in the forests
    surrounding the Temple Ruins. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a
  name="rouge" id="rouge"></a>D. Under Her Spell </h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Just when you think you've solved all of the romantic
    problems at the Jermien household in Umar Hills, a new set of problems move
    in. NB: This quest can only be completed if you haven't already travelled
    through the Planar Sphere. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a
  name="medley" id="medley"></a>E. Character Medley </h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>So named because the component name &quot;Random
    Encounters&quot; has already been taken. This component will add a selection
    of characters to the game so that your Bhaalspawn will have even more
    strangers to chat with (or threaten/main/kill as the case may be). The
    experience/items gained from these quests are so miniscule/useless that the
    encounters not listed as separate quests. But hopefully they capture the
    feeling of some of the more bizarre episodes in the original Baldur's Gate.
    Think of The Great Gazib, and you'll know what I'm talking about. </p>

<h3><a name="warning" id="warning"></a> II. WARNING FOR FR PURISTS</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>** WARNING ** If you are a Forgotten Realms purist who is concerned
    with the upkeep of all things canon, then it's more than likely that this mod
    will offend your sense of what is a possibility and what is not in the FR
    universe. While the fourth wall is never broken, some laws of FR existence
    might be. Play at your own risk! </p>

</blockquote>
<h3><a name="install" id="install"></a> IV. INSTALLATION</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Windows</strong><br />
The mod is packaged and
    installed with <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> and
    is distributed as a self-extracting archive. To install, simply double-click
    the archive and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
  <p>Alternatively the files can be extracted from the archive using <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/">WinRAR</a>.
    If properly extracted, you should have a emad folder and setup-emad.exe
    in your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder. To install,
    simply double-click setup-emad.exe and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
  <p>Please run setup-emad.exe in your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder
    to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
  <p><strong>Mac <acronym title="Operating System 10">OS X</acronym></strong><br />
    <em>If the mod was previously installed, uninstall it before extracting the
      new version.</em> The <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2 </acronym>Fixpack
    is packaged and installed with <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>.
    To install, simply extract the contents of the mod into your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder.
    If properly extracted, you should have a emad folder, setup-emad,
    and setup-emad.command in your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder.
    To install, simply double-click <strong>Setup-emad.command</strong> and
    follow the instructions on screen.</p>
  <p><strong>Linux</strong><br />
    Download the latest version of <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> for
    Linux from <a href="https://github.com/WeiDUorg/weidu/releases/latest">here</a> and extract
    (at least) the <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>,
    weinstall and tolower executables in a $PATH directory (E.G. /usr/bin). Following that, open a terminal, cd to your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> installation directory, run `tolower' and answer Y to both queries.</p>
  <p> You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini)
    if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save time, the
    archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the first option
    (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only this mod since
    the last time you lower cased file name. If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both
    options is the safe bet.</p>
  <p> After that, run 'weinstall emad from your game installation directory
    to install or uninstall the mod. </p>
  <p><a href="#top"><strong>Back to top</strong></a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="uninstall" id="uninstall"></a> V. UNINSTALLATION &gt;:( </h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>To uninstall, double-click the <strong>setup-emad.exe</strong> (or setup-emad for OS X) file and enter the given commands for Uninstallation. 
    Afterwards, you may delete the following
    files: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>setup-emad.tp2 </li>
    <li>setup-emad.debug </li>
    <li>setup-emad.exe/setup-emad</li>

<h3><a name="compat" id="compat"></a> VI. COMPATIBILITY </h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>EMaD <i>should</i> be compatible with all other WeiDU
    mods, although conflicts are always a possibility. If you discover a
    conflict, please report it at the EMaD support forum (link above). </p>

<h3><a name="spoiler" id="spoiler"></a>VIII. SPOILERS </h3>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Finding the extra
    characters/quests.</strong> </p>
  <p>I'd highly recommend just playing through the game
    and bumping into the characters as you go. Most of them are designed so that
    they'll walk up to you when they see you, or have such improbable colour
    schemes that you can't help but notice them. However...</p>

				Baldur's Gate Mini Quests and Encounters
					Modification 
		for BG1 (with or without TotSC), BG1Tutu v4, EasyTutu und BGT
				by jastey (jastey@web.de)
					Version 8.1

Baldur's Gate Mini Quests and Encounters Modification (BGQE) is a mini-mod for "vanilla" BG1 (with or without the add-on Tales of the Sword Coast), BG1Tutu v4, EasyTutu, and BGT, adding several small quests and encounters to the game. It includes the "slime quest", my former stand alone BG1 mini quest mod (which was originally my (winning) submission for the Black Wyrm Forums Modding Contest (http://www.blackwyrmlair.net/).)

The duration of the game time added by this mod is approximately 30 to 60 minutes, depending on playing style.

DESCRIPTION

1. Slime Quest

This quest is located in Beregost. If you pass one of the houses in the northwest, a woman dressed in red should approach you. There are some strange things going on in the house of her neighbor, and she wants your help.

This release revises the quest to meet known compatibility issues and adds a (more) evil quest solution. 

2. Family Treasure Quest

This quest is also located in Beregost. If you go into another house in the northwest, you will meet a strange couple. They obviously have a serious problem, but haven't talked to each other for some time now. Although it seems that they aren't interested in talking to you either, it might just be that you can solve the riddle and ease their worries... or betray them and ruin the family completely.

3. Babysitting in Nashkel, including Carnival Encounter

This quest occurs in Nashkel. Did you meet the desperate mother of two little children? She has something important to do, and is in great need of a trustworthy person who will watch over her children while she is away. So, fearless monster fighter, will you be ready for this challenge?

This quest is only solvable if the PC's reputation is higher than 12 or if the PC is a paladin.

At the Nashkel carnival, you can find Tina. The young woman is another tragic soul in need of some money... or so she says.

4. Monster in Nashkel

Near the Manor House in Nashkel you can save little Arnim from a monster that's chasing him. He is staying with his parents in the Nashkel Inn. For such a heroic deed, the thankfulness of his parents should be all yours... shouldn't it?

5. Fallen Paladin in Baldur's Gate

In the northern part of the city, in the temple of Helm, an evil fallen paladin is hiding. He slaughtered a little girl without hesitation... at least that's what the angry people in front of the temple are saying.

6. Undying Love in the Fishing Village

The frightened woman in the left house tells you she is threatened by a monster hiding behind her house. Maybe you should go and take a look?

7. Lovesick Half-Orc

On the road north of Nashkel, you meet Uguth. He is on his way to Baldur's Gate, to his beloved. Due to his appearance, being clearly descended from orcs, he has to overcome a special hindrance before he can take her into his arms.

8. Unexpected Help

In the Candlekeep infirmary, glum Sir Trun seeks healing from his wounds. He was injured badly in a fight, but that doesn't seem to be his actual problem, as Linda, his fiancee who is staying in Candlekeep Inn, can tell you...

This quest is accessible both during the Prologue or after the return to Candlekeep.

9. Extension of Bjornin Encounter

Bjornin, the hurt paladin in Beregost, impressed my PC deeply when meeting him the first time. So she wanted to be able to talk to him some more.

This component enables PCs (male and female) of reputations greater than 9 to have a more extensive conversation with Bjornin. This might be seen as a romantic encounter for female PCs, but don't expect too much from an injured paladin.


INSTALLATION
 
General (Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux)
Make sure you back up your dialog.tlk file (and dialogf.tlk, if it exists), just to be sure. Extract the contents of the mod archive to your game's main directory. 
Your game's main directory would be:
your main original Baldur's Gate folder for vanilla Baldur's Gate
your main EasyTutu folder for EasyTutu
your main Tutu folder for Tutu
your main BGT folder for BGT.

Note: Before installation, uninstall any version of the "slime quest". There is no automatic detection! Also uninstall and delete every older version of BGQE before extracting the contens of this mod into your directory.

Also, if you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting the new version. To do this, uninstall all previously installed components and delete the mod folder and executables. When installing or uninstalling, do not close the DOS window by clicking on the X button! Instead, press the Enter key when instructed to do so.

To finally install the mod, follow the instructions:

Windows
On successful extraction, there should be an bgqe folder and a setup-bgqe.exe file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click setup-bgqe.exe and follow the instructions on screen.
Run setup-bgqe.exe in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.

Mac OS X
Make sure you have the Mac OS X version of the mod (named "OSX-BGQE-vx.zip"). If properly extracted, you should have a bgqe folder, setup-bgqe, and setup-bgqe.command in your game's main directory folder. To install, simply double-click setup-bgqe.command and follow the instructions on screen.

Linux
Make sure you have the Linux version of the mod (named "lin-bgqe-vx.zip").
Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from WeiDU.org and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal, cd to your BG installation directory, run 'tolower' and answer Y to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you have already ran it once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered, so there is no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names) either if you have extracted only this mod since the last time you lower cased file name. If you are unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.
Run WeInstall setup-bgqe in your game folder to install the mod. Then run wine BGMain.exe and start playing.



You don't have to start a new game to play the mod.

If you have installation problems or encounter any bugs, please contact me via the above e-mail or post your bug report in one of the forum threads given below.

COMPATIBILITY

Baldur's Gate Mini Quests and Encounters Mod is coded using WeiDU and does not overwrite any files. It should be compatible with most other (WeiDU) mods. 

If you play it with the original BG, the mod is compatible with
-Echon's "Field of the Dead" (Version 1.07)

For original BG, the mod should also be technically compatible with (this does not necessarily imply that the listed mods are all compatible with each other):
-BG1 Unfinished Business
-NTotSC (non-WeiDU)
-Grey Clan Episode 1
-Herbs and Potions Add-In
-BG1 Adventure and CoM Forge
-BG1 Ajantis Expansion Mod
-Xan Friendship Mod

For Tutu please look into "Tutu Mod Compatibility and Order of Install" at G3:
http://forums.gibberlings3.net/index.php?showtopic=8122

Compatibility with BG1 Ajantis Expansion Mod is fulfilled.

I am interested in your experience concerning compatibility so please let me know other mods with which you've played this mod, also (especially) if you didn't encounter any problems.

I want to thank all who have helped me making this mod.

Have fun playing this quest mod!

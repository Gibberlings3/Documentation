      <p>Yoshimo's Remorse is a mod for BG2EE that makes Yoshimo a playable character in Throne of Bhaal. However, he is not what you expect him to be...</p>

      <p> First time installing a mod? Check out <abbr title="The Gibberlings Three">G3</abbr>&#39;s comprehensive tutorial: <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/topic/33164-a-new-player%E2%80%99s-guide-to-installing-and-playing-mods/">A New Player's Guide to Installing and Playing Mods</a>. </p>
      <p><strong>Enhanced Editions Note</strong><br />
        The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game&#39;s folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages. </p>
      <p><strong>Windows</strong><br />
        Yoshimo's Remorse for Windows is distributed as a zip file and the files can be extracted into your game directory using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a> or <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-yoshimosremorse.exe</strong> and the folder <strong>yoshimosremorse</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-yoshimosremorse.exe</strong> and follow the instructions on screen. </p>
      <p> You can run <strong>setup-yoshimosremorse.exe</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components. </p>
      <p><strong>macOS</strong><br />
        Yoshimo's Remorse for macOS is distributed as a compressed tarball and includes a <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr> installer. </p>
      <p> First, extract the files from the tarball into your game directory. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-yoshimosremorse</strong>, <strong>setup-yoshimosremorse.command</strong>, and the folder <strong>yoshimosremorse</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-yoshimosremorse.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen. </p>
      <p> You can run <strong>setup-yoshimosremorse.command</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components. </p>
      <p><strong>Linux</strong><br />
        Yoshimo's Remorse for Linux is distributed as a compressed tarball and does not include a <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr> installer. Linux users will need to do a one-time install of <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr> (and a few other adjustments) as described in <a href="https://moebiusproject.gitlab.io/mods_on_linux">this great writeup</a>. </p>
      <p> To install, run &#39;WeInstall yoshimosremorse in your game folder. </p>
      <p><strong>Note for Complete Uninstallation</strong><br />
        In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely uninstall the mod using setup-yoshimosremorse --uninstall at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts. </p>

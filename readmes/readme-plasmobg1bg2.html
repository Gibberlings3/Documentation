      <p><strong>Special Note for Siege of Dragonspear from Steam/GOG<br />
      </strong>Good Old Games (GOG) and Steam both package the     additional content for Siege of Dragonspear in a method that WeiDU, the     tool used to install this mod, cannot access. You must  run a program     called <a href="https://forums.beamdog.com/discussion/71305/mod-dlc-merger-merge-steam-gog-sod-dlc-or-custom-dlcs-with-the-main-game">DLC Merger</a> on your SoD installation  before you can install this or any other WeiDU-based mod.</p>
      <p><strong>Enhanced Editions Note</strong><br />
      The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every   patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a   modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as   even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with   your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a   new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. For BG2:EE it is important that you install the mod to the language   version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod   will not show but give error messages. </p>
      <p><strong>Windows</strong><br />
      Plasmocat's &quot;BG NPC Portraits in BG2 Style&quot; for Windows is distributed as a self-extracting   archive and includes a WeiDU installer. To install, simply double-click   the archive and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, the files can be extracted into your game directory using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a> or <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-plasmobg1bg2.exe</strong> and the folder<strong> plasmobg1bg2</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-plasmobg1bg2.exe</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-plasmobg1bg2.exe</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>Mac OS X</strong><br />
      Plasmocat's &quot;BG NPC Portraits in BG2 Style&quot;  for Mac OS X is distributed as a compressed tarball and includes a WeiDU installer.</p>
      <p>First, extract the files from the tarball into your game directory. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-plasmobg1bg2</strong>, <strong>setup-plasmobg1bg2.command</strong>, and the folder <strong>plasmobg1bg2</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-plasmobg1bg2.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-plasmobg1bg2.command</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>Linux</strong><br />
      Plasmocat's &quot;BG NPC Portraits in BG2 Style&quot;  for Linux is distributed as a compressed tarball and does not include a WeiDU installer.</p>
      <p>Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.</p>
      <p>Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="http://www.weidu.org/%7Ethebigg/">WeiDU.org</a> and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal, cd to your game installation directory, run tolower   and answer Y to both queries. You can avoid running the second option   (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save   time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the   first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only   this mod since the last time you lowercased file names. If you're   unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.</p>
      <p>To install, run WeInstall plasmobg1bg2 in your game folder. Then run wine BGMain.exe and start playing. </p>
      <p><strong> Note for Complete Uninstallation</strong><br />
        In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely uninstall the mod using setup-plasmobg1bg2 --uninstall at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts. . </p>

<div class="kit_description"><p><strong>I hope you enjoy using these portraits</strong> as much as I enjoyed making them and playing them myself. Thanks to everyone who has provided constructive feedback, both challenging and inspiring me to do better work. I appreciate your support.</p>
<p>This mod started as a personal project because I wanted to use Tutu to improve the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> interface but at the same time really don't like the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> style of portraits. Rather than continue to use pics of completely different characters to hedge the problem, I decided to do a revamp of the whole works. </p>
<p>A few notes on the pics: I completely refaced (literally) Shar Teel and Faldorn because it's just my preference to have better-looking people in my games. I also completely overhauled Coran, making him look more like an elf rather than a mutant human. I collaborated with Domi on this in that she Beta'd my work and provided some pen &amp; ink drawings of elves she obtained from official <acronym title="Dungeons and Dragons">D&amp;D</acronym> illustrations. I tried to create a hybrid style that incorporated these old school elements with some of the traits portrayed in the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> elves as well, all while keeping his &quot;am I not hot?&quot; personality evident. I gave Alora red hair instead of pink because I didn't want her to compete or become confused with Imoen. </p>
<p>I made two versions of Xzar, one presenting him in the colors he wears in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> and one reflecting the colors he wears in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>. You can choose which one to install! I also created two versions of Imoen; one suitable for a Swashbuckler, and the other more consistent with Imoen's <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> character. You have a choice of one of these as well. </p>
<p>I didn't make replacement portraits for Edwin or Minsc; if you want to use the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> versions on a Tutu game, install <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Caharacter">NPC</acronym> and the portraits are there. I did edit the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> Jaheira portrait mainly because I wanted to use it as a <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym>.</p>
<p> I hope you enjoy using these portraits as much as I enjoyed making them and playing them myself. Thanks to everyone who has provided constructive and appreciative feedback. I appreciate your support. Thanks to CamDawg for providing space for my stuff. Special thanks to cmorgan for making this mod happen, because I don't do my own scripting and wanted to make these portraits available. I'm honored to work with you and grateful for your help. </p>

			BS Company Presents:
                        ---  Balduran's Seatower  ---
		Modification for BGT, BG:EE, and EET
		

*Citizens of Baldur's Gate!

We are happy to give you the chance to take a stroll around the Balduran's Seatower!

Enter and be at awe at the great architecture, the wonders, and hidden treasures that will await anyone bold enough to enter the tower with adventures in mind!*	

This is an Early Access Open Beta version (EAOB). 
Expect bugs and please report anything you'll find in the BST Forum at Gibberlings!	 
All existing quests of the EAOB are finishable but more content is planned for future versions. 

BS Balduran's Seatower Modification (BST) is a mod for BGT, BG:EE, and EET, adding a new area to Baldur's Gate City, with several larger and small quests and encounters inside the new city district as well as related additions to the existing areas.



DESCRIPTION

The Seatower Area is accessible via the far south-west corner of the Docks Disrict. After visiting once, it is accessible via the worldmap.
In the Early Access Open Beta there is also a direct travel trigger from the docks to the seatower area.

The Early Access Open Beta has approximately 50% of the planned content which can be played without any loose ends. It is directly compatible with BGT, BG:EE w/o SoD, and EET.

If you need the Worldmap for other mods, install it after BST and use the current 10.2.6.

You can play from a previous save if it is from before entering BG city for the first time. In this case, the Seatower will not show on your worldmap but is accessible through a direct travel link from the south west corner of the docks.

Have a look at the readme to see a list of the available quests - but don't spoil yourself too much! Everything starts by entering the Seatower area. 

Note: After installation of the EAOB, you need to play a new game or at least a save where you did not visit the BG City Areas before.
The Seatower Area is reachable via a direct travel trigger from the south-west corner of the Docks.
For a new game, the Seatower Area will also be on the worldmap. 



LIST OF COMPONENTS (EAOB)

"An Orphan in the Seatower": 
-------------------------------
Given after talking to the "Legal Assistant" on the first floor of the Seatower (Inn). 

Walkthrough: PC needs to talk to Lady Springfall on the second floor of the tower and tell her how the boy looks. PC can lie for evil quest end. Quest ends after meeting the boy on the first floor again.
There are two quest ends:
-if the PC lies to Lady Springfall she will abandon the boy.
-if the PC tells the truth Lady Springfall will adopt the boy.
Quest reward item is "Lars' Drawing" which has no use whatsoever. 


"Cage the Rabbits":
-------------------------------
Given by Inn Master Roryn after incident on third floor for quest "Strange Happenings in Room No. 3.4" if none of the rabbit were killed. 

Walkthrough: The PC receives a cage and has to cage the rabbits on the third level of the Seatower (done by klicking on the rabbits). Quest ends after giving the cage back to Inn Master Roryn.
There is 11 rabbits in total. The quest can be ended any time by giving back the cage, quest reward is 50 gold for every caught rabbit. 


"Confront the Slave Traders in Baldur's Gate": 
-------------------------------
Given by Seatower Commander. 

Walkthrough: After learning that Leonhard "the Fierce" on the third floor of the Seatower is a slaver contact, the PC can tell the Seatower Commander about it. To confront the slave traders two things are needed:
1. the PC needs to gather information about *where* the slavers will transfer slaves next.
2. the PC needs to gather information about *when* the slavers will transfer slaves next.
There are different possibilities to gather these information, depending on whether the PC is working with the smugglers or not (quest "Working with the Smugglers"):
-If working with the smugglers, the PC will be summoned to Leonhard "the Fierce" into the Seatower and get information about when and where. With these information, the PC can go to the Seatower Commander.
-Independent on whether the PC is working with the smugglers, the information can be gathered by freeing Shuck's brother (quest "Help Shuck's Brother") and telling the Seatower Commander about it, and killing Leonhard "the Fierce" which will drop a booklet with all the dates. In this case the knowledge about where will be aquired viy Shuck's freed brother by the Seatower Commander (PC has to leave and return to the Commander for him to have the information).
3. After time and place are known, the slave traders can be confronted at night on the map with the bridge (Wyrm's Crossing) in the far south corner on the west bank of the river. A Flaming Fist Soldier will approach the PC before the meeting place of the slavers.
4. The PC needs to fight the slavers at the meeting point.
5. The quest is finished after talking to the Seatower Commander again.
Note: in BG:EE/EET the area can be left at the west border. Do not leave the area during the fight with the slavers because returning via the worldmap will bring you to the bridge again and not into the south corner so you'll have to walk back to the meeting point which might be immersion breaking.
Note: If the quest to save Shuck's brother was declined and the PC does not work with the smugglers, the slavers cannot be confronted. The booklet can still be brought to the Seatower Commander in case Leonhard was killed.
Note: if the PC works with the smugglers (quest "Working with the Smugglers"), the slavers can be confronted without the smugglers turning hostile as long as Leonhard "the Fierce", the slaver contact, was not killed.


"Dark Power in the Seatower Catacombs": 
-------------------------------
Given by abbot in the Ilmater Monastery. 

Walkthrough: PC will receive two keys (for legacy reasons it's two). The first opens the tomb in the "Chionthar Tower", the second one opens the hidden door inside the tomb to the catacombs. PC needs to talk to the Restles Dead in the far away tomb of the catacombs (behind a hidden door). Quest ends after reporting to the abbot.
Note: Depending on the behavior of the PC and whether the tombs are plundered, this quest can be finished without any fighting or a lot of fighting.


"Doppelgangers Inside the Seatower": 
-------------------------------
This is the main quest inside the tower which is connected to a lot of other quests.
Chapter 1-5: quest starts after or during quest "The Breach in the Seatower Prison": after the hole in the prison wall is reported to the Seatower Commander.
After Sarevok was revealed in the Duchal Palace (or is dead/BGII): quest starts directly by speaking to the Seatower Commander the first time.
Note: after the quest started there will be a quest timer of 5 to one ingame days depending on the quest status. Exceeding the timer while being away from the tower grounds or the seacave will set the quest to completed without the PC's help. 

Walkthrough: 
- Quest starts in the Seatower Commander's Office: he will be attacked by two doppelgangers.
- PC gets quest to investigate the hole in the prison wall ("The Breach in the Seatower Prison"). 
-PC has to go through the hole in the prison wall and further until the dopelgangers inside the tailor's shop are killed.
-After reporting about the doppelgangers in the Tailor's Shop to the Seatower Commander (officially for quest "The Breach in the Seatower Prison"), quest will proceed.
- PC will be asked to go into the barracks and help the Captain and the Seatower Mage against the doppelgangers inside the barracks. Refusing will skip to next quest status.
- PC will be asked to help against the doppelgangers on the seatower grounds. Quest item: "Mimic Powder". Approaching or talking to certain soldiers on the tower grounds with quest item in inventory will make them turn into doppelgangers. Refusing will skip to next quest status. Note: Disguised doppelgangers could also be attacked directly. They need to turn into doppelgangers to be counted for the quest, though.
Note: There is a total of five disguised doppelgangers on the tower grounds outside the barracks.
--1 in front of the treasury [1981.1259].
--1 on the balustrade between Dradeel's Tower and Dragon Tower [1532.1971].
--1 on top of the Chionthar Tower [777.1563].
--1 on the little balcony above the main entrance to the Seatower Inn (accessible from inside second floor) [3902.1287].
--1 inside the South Harbor Tower.
- PC can speed up the process by asking the tanner to use the Mimic Powder in one of his tubs to spread the fumes (activates quest "Liqueur for the Tanner" if not declined). If done so, all remaining doppelgangers will gather in front of the baracks. The amount of doppelgangers gathering in front of the barracks will be max 5 dependent on how many were already killed.
Note: if going to the tanner by entering via the Chaintower and going clock wise to the Traitor's Tower, no disguised doppelgangers will be met on the way. If going via South Harbor Tower, 4 of 5 disguised doppelgangers will be met before reaching the tanner.
- PC needs to talk to Captain again after defeating all 5 doppelgangers.
- Quest ends by talking to Seatower Commander.

Note: If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting the new version. To do this, uninstall all previously installed components and delete the mod folder and executables. When installing or uninstalling, do not close the DOS window by clicking on the X button! Instead, press the Enter key when instructed to do so.


BGII:EE
If you use BG Enhanced Edition from GOG or Steam, you need to prepare your game before installing any mods:

(deprecated tool: 
https://forums.beamdog.com/discussion/50441/modmerge-merge-your-steam-gog-zip-based-dlc-into-something-weidu-nearinfinity-dltcep-can-use/p1)

 
General (Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux)
Make sure you back up your game acordingly, just to be sure. 

Extract the contents of the mod archive to your game's main directory. 
NOTE: For BG:EE it is important that you istall the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages.


Windows
On successful extraction, there should be an bst folder and a setup-bst.exe file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click setup-bst.exe and follow the instructions on screen.
Run setup-bst.exe in your game folder also to uninstall the mod.

Mac OS X
If properly extracted, you should have a bst folder, setup-bst, and setup-bst.command in your game's main directory folder. To install, simply double-click setup-bst.command and follow the instructions on screen.
Also run setup-bst.command in your game folder to uninstall the mod.

Linux
Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from WeiDU.org and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal, cd to your BG installation directory, run 'tolower' and answer Y to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you have already ran it once in the same directory. If you are unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.
Run WeInstall setup-bst in your game folder to install the mod. Then run wine BGMain.exe and start playing.


NOTE: BG(II):EE are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames.

COMPATIBILITY

BS Balduran's Seatower Mod is coded using WeiDU and does not overwrite any files. It should be compatible with most other (WeiDU) mods. 

BP-Worldmap-Mod:
-The Seatower Mod is independent of the Worldmap Mod, but compatible. The new area will be patched to the Worldmap of all compatible games (BGT, BG:EE, EET). If the Worldmap Mod is needed for other mods, the preferred order would be BST - Worldmap Mod.
If the Worldmap Mod is installed after BST, the icon of the BST area will be also added but will be shifted on the worldmap.


KNOWN ISSUES

When uninstalling the mod there is error messages about "error copying" of several files (mainly are files) which can be ignored.

There are several items that still miss description items.

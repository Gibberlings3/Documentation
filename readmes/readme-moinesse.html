</div>
<h2>Contents </h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>The mod contains several components that can be installed independently of one another. </p>
  <p><strong>Elf Mage Female Avatars<br />
  </strong>These Avatars provide long-haired animation for robed and armored female mages</p>
  <p>To get the most enjoyment out of this Avatar, Please read this short instruction:</p>
  <p>The most important- Selecting your hair color:</p>
  <ul style="list-style-type:upper-alpha;">
    <li>  All avatar BAMs as well as the paperdoll are transparent, which allows you to choose your colors from a palette.</li>
    <li> All transparent (colors) have what is called a camera shot or highlight effect. For example, look at your original avatars on screen and you&rsquo;ll see a light spot on the top of the head as well as their clothing.</li>
    <li> Within your color spectrum (your color choices) you&rsquo;ll notice a small light center, with the colors radiating out toward the edges. (99% of the original <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> colors are this way). When colors are applied as an overlay your color choices will be applied light to dark etc. On short hair this looks good and normal, but not so for long hair.</li>
    <li> Be careful in your choice of color and try to choose a color with a darker middle or highlight.  </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Even so with the dark colors, such as black, you&rsquo;ll see a lot of highlights that look gray and will not look good with a dark dress. This was disappointing to me as well, but remember these are modified avatars not originals and the quality will not be the same. To choose stark black hair color, you will need to use ShadowKeeper or NI and set the hair color to solid black. </p>
  <p>Use your color spectrum with caution and enjoy.</p>
  <p><strong>Female Clerics and Druids Avatars<br />
  </strong>These Avatars provide long-haired animation with split skirts for female clerics and druids.</p>
  <p><strong>Male Half-Orc Paper Doll<br />
  </strong>This changes Half-Orc paper doll to something more artistic.</p>
  <p><strong> Female Human Fighter Avatars<br />
  </strong>This is the avatar for heavy armor only (plate); you won't get the longer hair while wearing light or medium armor.</p>
  <p><strong>Male Human Barbarian Avatars<br />
  </strong>Makes human male barbarians appear, well, barbaric.</p>
  <p><strong>Male Human Mage in Robes + 3 and a paperdoll<br />
  </strong>These BAMs were made with the human male mage. You won't see this avatar unless you have a +3 armor like the Robe of Vecna. A paper doll is included. </p>
  <p><strong> Female Human Mage in Robes + 3 and a paperdoll<br />
  </strong>These BAMs were made with the Human Female Mage. You won't see this avatar unless you have a +3 armor like the Robe of Vecna. Paperdoll  included with BAMs. </p>
  <p><strong> Male Monk Avatars (Ninja)<br />
  </strong>These BAMs were made to replace the Monk avatar. It also includes a character portrait.</p>
  <p>You must use ShadowKeeper in order change all colors to black which you cannot do inside the game i.e. armor, metal, leather, major and minor clothing. Be careful when using a vest or armor. There are some that changes the color of the clothing. I have revised several leather vest and armor to a black color. It is easy to do if you have Near Infinity. If not I&rsquo;m sure someone has these items for download. A Ninja should not be wearing armor at all. It takes away from the character. Use rings and amulets to enhance his stats.</p>
  <p>A thief kit of Shuri Ninja by Twinblade can be found here: <a href="http://members.lycos.co.uk/twinblades/">http://members.lycos.co.uk/twinblades/</a> Using ShadowKeeper you can change the appearance to Monk Male Human and all color choices (except skin) to black (value of 0x42).</p>
  <p><strong>Female Monk Avatars (Ninja)<br />
  </strong>Replaces a female monk animation and paperdoll with the same ninja avatar.</p>
  <p><strong> Female Rogue Avatars<br />
  </strong>This component  replaces human female thieves and bards with new avatars.</p>
  <p><strong>Male Vampire Avatars<br />
  </strong>Replaces Male Vampire Avatars with new avatars.</p>
  <p><strong>Female Vampire Avatars</strong><br />
  Replaces Male Vampire Avatars with new avatars.</p>
  <p><strong> Male Vampire Avatars for Male Thieves<br />
  </strong>Replaces Male Thieves Avatars with Vampire Avatars. </p>

  <p><strong><a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/">A Gibberlings
    Three Mod</a><br />
    Author: Eric Kerr (aka Cirerrek)</strong></p>

  <p><strong> Version 0.6 Beta- <a href="http://gibberlings3.net/forums/index.php?app=downloads&amp;showcat=25">Check
    for the most recent version</a></strong></p>
</div>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>The iSeries is a set of very beta versions of my scripts for Icewind
    Dale II. So far the scripts only use a limited number of
    spells. Otherwise they appear to do most of the other things
    the eSeries was designed to do: Threat Level Assessment,
    Weapon Switching, Move to Combat, and a few other things.
    They're NOT going to be able to strut their stuff with
    a high level party. Packaging is very basic. Constructive
    feedback is encouraged. Use iBard for Bards, iArcher for
    Mages, and iFighter for Fighter types or Cleric types. </p>
</div>

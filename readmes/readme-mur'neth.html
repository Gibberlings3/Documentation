</div>
<h2>Contents</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>This mod contains two components. The first is the joinable <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Mur'Neth.
    Though it was planned as a One - Day <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> inspired
    by the <a href="http://www.pocketplane.net/oneday">Pocket Plane Group</a>,
    since the initial version a lot more content has been added and it has as
    much as, or more than, any other <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym>.
    The second is an option to replace the rare selection sounds with common
    ones.</p>
  <p><strong>Mur'Neth</strong><br />
    This component adds the new <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> to
    the game. Mur'Neth can be found inside the Nashkel Mines on the penultimate
    floor, near a pool of water in the bottom - left corner of the map. He is
    a Ghaunadan, a member of the race of ooze - like shapechangers who venerate
    Ghaunadaur, the evil deity of oozes, moulds and the like. He is of Chaotic
    Evil alignment and has the following statistics:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><acronym title="Strength">STR</acronym>: 17 </li>
    <li><acronym title="Dexterity">DEX</acronym>: 16</li>
    <li><acronym title="Constitution">CON</acronym>: 16</li>
    <li><acronym title="Intelligence">INT</acronym>: 11</li>
    <li><acronym title="Wisdom">WIS</acronym>: 10</li>
    <li><acronym title="Charisma">CHR</acronym>: 14</li>
  </ul>
  <p>He has a unique kit, based on the thief class. When encountered he is Level
    3 with no particular bias in skills. His proficiencies are in club and dagger
    and he has a small amount of equipment. The kit is as follows:</p>
  <div class="kit_description">
    <p>GHAUNADAN: These vile, intelligent monsters are the loyal servants of
      Ghaunadaur, the evil deity venerated by oozes, slimes, jellies and some
      drow. Ghaunadans are similar to oozes, but they are quite intelligent and
      can form their bodies into the shape of an attractive humanoid. In its
      natural form, a ghaunadan resembles an ooze-like creature such as an ochre
      jelly or green slime. Ghaunadans lack many of the advantages of thieves,
      but make up for these with unique abilities of their own, such as their
      charming gaze and unique resistances.</p>
    <p>Advantages: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>May cast Friends once per day per 2 levels.</li>
      <li>Immune to blindness, poison, disease, sleep, paralysis and stunning.
        In addition, they have 10% resistance to bludgeoning damage.</li>
      <li>Can make an Ooze Touch attack once per day per 3 levels. This ability
        lasts for 5 rounds. The attack does <acronym title="1 roll of a 6-sided die">1d6</acronym> damage
        and the target must save vs. poison or be held for 5 rounds.</li>
      <li>Can shapeshift between ooze and human forms once per day per 5 levels.
        While in ooze form, all the character's attacks are paralytic. There
        is no limit to the time spent in either form.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Disadvantages: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Only gets 15 skill points per level.</li>
      <li>Cannot set traps.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <p>His biography is as follows:</p>
  <p>When you ask about his past, MUR'NETH turns towards you and lets out a long,
    tortured gurgle. Although his true form is that of an ooze, he seems comfortable
    being referred to as a male.</p>
  <p>You glean from his words a deep devotion to his deity Ghaunadaur, creator
    of his race. Mur'Neth reveals this is typical for his kind - they truly live
    to serve him. Mur'Neth was spawned only recently to investigate the tainting
    of the ores beneath the Nashkel Mines, which has resulted in the deaths of
    many of the native oozes and moulds in the area. This displeased Ghaunadaur
    greatly, though he seems content to permit Mur'Neth to accompany you for
    now...</p>
  <p><strong>Remove Rare Select Sounds</strong><br />
    <em>Requires Mur'Neth</em></p>
  <p> The NPCs in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> had rare select
    sounds, but the way <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> works
    these aren't so rare when playing Tutu. Tutu <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> have
    an option to replace these rare selection sounds with common ones from their
    soundset. So at Ghreyfain's request, I've done this for Mur'Neth too. Obviously,
    it requires that the first component be installed...</p>

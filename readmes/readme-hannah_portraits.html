<h1>HANNAH's PORTRAIT PACK</h1>
<div class="section">
  <p><strong><a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/">A Gibberlings Three Mod</a><br />
    Author: Hannah Wallace (packaged by <a href="http://gibberlings3.net/forums/?showuser=1067">DavidW</a></strong> <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net">www.gibberlings3.net)</a></strong></p>
  <p><strong>Version 1 </strong>
    <strong> Languages:</strong> English<br />
    <strong> Platforms: </strong>Windows, Mac OS X, Linux</p>
</div>
<h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>This is a package to provide additional custom portraits for assignment to your Player Character (<acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym>). It contains no additional content and does not touch your installation.</p>
</div>
<h2>COMPATIBILITY</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>There are no known incompatibilities. The Portrait Pack simply copies Hannah's portraits into the portraits subdirectory of your game directory. It can be installed at any time. Assign the appropriate portraits to your PC  through the character generation screen. Be sure to use the S and M/l portraits for <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym>, Tutu, <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>, or <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym>.</p>
</div>
<h2>INSTALLATION</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p><strong>Windows</strong><br />
  Hannah's Portrait Pack is packaged and installed with <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> and is distributed as a self-extracting archive. To install, double-click the archive and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
  <p>Alternatively the files can be extracted from the archive using <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/">WinRAR</a>. If properly extracted, you should have a <strong>"hannah_portraits"</strong> folder and <strong>setup-hannah_portraits.exe</strong> in your game installation folder. To install, double-click <strong>setup-hannah_portraits.exe</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
  <p>Please run setup-hannah_portraits.exe in your game folder to reinstall or uninstall.</p>
  <p><strong>Mac OS X</strong><br />
  Hannah's Portrait Pack is packaged and installed with <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>.
  To install, extract the contents of the mod into your game folder. If properly extracted, you should have a <strong>"hannah_portraits"</strong> folder, <strong>setup-hannah_portraits</strong>, and <strong>setup-hannah_portraits.command</strong> in your game installation folder. To install, double-click <strong>setup-hannah_portraits.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
  <strong>Linux</strong><br />
Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify. Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from
<a href="http://www.weidu.org/~thebigg "><acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>.org</a> and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin.
Following that, open a terminal, cd to your BG2 installation directory, run 'tolower' and answer Y to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini)
if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names)
either if you've extracted only this mod since the last time you lower cased file name. If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.<br />
Run <strong>WeInstall hannah_portraits</strong> in your game folder to install the mod. Then run <strong>wine BGMain.exe</strong> and start playing.</p>

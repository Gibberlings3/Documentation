      <h3>Special Note for Siege of Dragonspear from Steam/GOG</h3>
      <p>Good Old Games (GOG) and Steam both package the additional content for Siege of Dragonspear in a method that WeiDU, the tool used to install this mod, cannot access. You must run a program called <a href="https://forums.beamdog.com/discussion/50441/modmerge-merge-your-steam-gog-zip-based-dlc-into-something-weidu-nearinfinity-dltcep-can-use/p1">Modmerge</a> on your SoD installation before you can install this or any other WeiDU-based mod.</p>
      <h3>Enhanced Editions Note</h3>
      <p>The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. For BG:EE it is important that you install the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages.</p>
      <h3>Windows</h3>
      <p>Glam's NPC Pack for Windows is distributed as a self-extracting archive and includes a WeiDU installer. To install, simply double-click the archive and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, the files can be extracted into your game directory using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a> or <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-GlamNPCPack.exe</strong> and the folder <strong>GlamNPCPack</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-GlamNPCPack.exe</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-GlamNPCPack.exe</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <h3>Mac OS X</h3>
      <p>Glam's NPC Pack for Mac OS X is distributed as a compressed ZIP file and includes a WeiDU installer.</p>
      <p>First, extract the files from the ZIP file into your game directory. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-GlamNPCPack</strong>, <strong>setup-GlamNPCPack.command</strong>, and the folder <strong>GlamNPCPack</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-GlamNPCPack.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-GlamNPCPack.command</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <h3>Linux</h3>
      <p>Glam's NPC Pack for Linux is distributed as a compressed ZIP file and does not include a WeiDU installer.</p>
      <p>Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.</p>
      <p>Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="http://www.weidu.org/%7Ethebigg/">WeiDU.org</a> and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal, cd to your game installation directory, run tolower and answer Y to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only this mod since the last time you lowercased file names. If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.</p>
      <p>To install, run WeInstall GlamNPCPack in your game folder. Then run wine BGMain.exe and start playing.</p>
      <h3>Note for Complete Uninstallation</h3>
      <p>In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely uninstall the mod using setup-GlamNPCPack --uninstall at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts.</p>

        <h3>What is this?</h3>
        <p>The BGEE NPC Pack includes the original Vynd, Drow Assassin NPC mod as well as four brand new NPCs, all of whom will interact with each other and the classic Baldur's Gate cast. Each one includes a friendship track and an array of player-initiated dialogue, with more options opening up as the game progresses.</p>
        <p>You want quests? This time we got 'em! Three of the four new characters come with their own personal missions, which must be completed to unlock all their player-initiated dialogue, plus a final, loyalty-inspired talk in the endgame.</p>
        <p>You want loot? There's plenty of new and unique items to be had; some supplied with the characters, others found through their quests, or just indiscriminate slaughter. Hoard them all!</p>
        <p>You want romance? Nope. Sorry.</p>

            <p><em>"I don't necessarily like shooting people. Some people just need shot."</em></p>
            <p>When asked about her past, Littlun proudly informs you of how she was taken in as a baby by a tribe of elves, who raised her as one of their own. However, while she is very much a product of the wilds, the mechanical, rapid-fire crossbow she carries is the work of her long-deceased father, once a master craftsman and wandering scholar. She is a walking contradiction, a juxtaposition of untamed nature and advanced technology.</p>

            <p><em>"Why leave? Because in the Underdark, there are mind flayers, beholders and aboleths. Up here, there are sheep. And trees. So I weighed things up and I thought, you know what? How bad could a little sunburn possibly be?"</em></p>
            <p>When asked about his past, Vynd wonders aloud how you'd feel if some nosy bastard you barely know asked for your life story. You've pieced together that he's not new to the surface world, and he left the Underdark by choice. Beyond that, he remains a mystery. A snide, abrasive mystery.</p>

            <p><em>"Violence is a fact of life, war is a corpse mill, and blood is red juice that stains. I won't put out my eyes to see glory where there is none."</em></p>
            <p>When asked about her past, Moidre says little, which you've quickly come to realise is normal for her. Her helmet, which she refuses to remove even when ordered, hides her countenance from the world, and her voice rarely wavers from its flat inflection, making her as easy to engage with as a brick; however, her intense discipline marks her as something more than common sellsword.</p>

            <p>When asked about his past, Dave chuckles and says it's not the past you should be interested in, but the present. Born to a single mother in a quiet village, Dave seems to have joined the church of Talos on a whim, for there was no outside force, nor troubled childhood, nor deranged power-hunger to compel him. Despite this, he expresses no doubts or regrets over his chosen path, and refuses to be swayed from it.</p>

            <p>Before you even had the chance to ask about her past, Flara insisted she was once a powerful red dragon, who is now trapped in human form. This may be true, or it may not; she can offer no concrete explanation for how such a predicament came about, nor does she recall much of her time before it. Nevertheless, the air around her ripples with heat, and her fiery breath is difficult to argue with, though not as much as her temperament.</p>

        <p>Only Vynd and Kivan will come to blows, and it can be prevented by talking to Vynd before things escalate too far.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Anything else?</h3>
        <p>While it is intended that none of these characters (except Littlun) care about the party's reputation, this feature still doesn't work in the Enhanced Edition. If you want to use them all together, I recommend installing the Happy Patch component of the <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/mods/tweaks/tweaks/">Tweaks Anthology</a>. It's okay. You're not breaking the rules.</p>
        <p>While Moidre is neutral, she responds best to a high reputation. If you want to get the most out of her, be good.</p>
        <p>Keep Gorion's letter! Having it in your inventory unlocks some additional player-initiated dialogues for each character.</p>
        <p>Don't tell Vynd you love him. You've been warned.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>What if I just want Vynd?</h3>
        <p>Vynd is the same snarky drow he always was, and aside from his interactions with the new <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym>, nothing's changed. If you've played or intend to play the Vynd mod by itself, don't worry. You're not missing anything.</p>

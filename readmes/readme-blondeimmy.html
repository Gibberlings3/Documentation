      This mod allows Imoen to have lovely, blonde hair.  Ok, I can't guarantee its lovelyness but it is blonde!  You have the option of giving her short, blonde hair (Normal Imoen length) or longer blonde hair (Aerie-ish length).

      <strong>Blonde Imoen</strong><br />
      This component will change Imoen's avatars to have blonde hair and will change her portrait to that of Imoen with short blonde hair.

    <p>
      <strong>Long Hair for Blonde Imoen (Requires Blonde Imoen)</strong><br />
      This component requires the first component to be installed.  It will change Imoen's avatars to that of an elven mage (who has long hair) and will change her portrait to that of Imoen with long blonde hair.  A side effect of this component is that she will becomes shorter (as elves are shorter than humans).

      Version History
    </h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Version 4</strong><br />
      After some discussion it was agreed that Blonde Imoen had too much hair and it was far too 80s.  So I started again and produced a new Blonde Imoen and this time you have the choice of long hair or short hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Version 3</strong><br />
      Jester recommended I flipped part of her hair-line so that it faces the same direction her face. The portrait has been updated...
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Version 2</strong><br />
      Domi recommended, that I more Imoen's hairline down to make her more feminine. She was right. It does! The portrait has been updated...
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Version 1</strong><br />
      Bloody hell!  It worked!  Woohoo!
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Beta 1</strong><br />
      First version of the mod.

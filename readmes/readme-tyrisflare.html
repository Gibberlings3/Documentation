      <p>Meet Tyris Flare, a red-haired amazon who can kick ass and hurl fire!</p>
      <p>Sound familiar?  That's because I decided to have a nostalgia trip
        and recreate a character from ye olde Golden Axe computer games that were
        released on the Sega Mega Drive (or Genesis in America) and arcade machines in
        the 90s.  You may also have seen her recently in Golden Axe: Beast Master, though
        my interpretation of the character is from the older games.</p>
      <p>How does she end up in Baldur's Gate II?  You'll have to play to find out!</p>
      <p>Once in your party, Tyris will banter with all BioWare NPCs and can be romanced
        by any human/elf/half-elf male PC.  Enjoy!</p>

      <p><strong>Enhanced Editions Note</strong><br />
        The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every   patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a   modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as   even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with   your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a   new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. For BG:EE it is important that you install the mod to the language   version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod   will not show but give error messages. </p>
      <p><strong>Windows</strong><br />
        Tyris Flare for Windows is distributed as a self-extracting   archive and includes a WeiDU installer. To install, simply double-click   the archive and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, the files can be extracted into your game directory using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a> or <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-tyrisflare.exe</strong> and the folder <strong>tyrisflare</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-tyrisflare.exe</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-tyrisflare.exe</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>Mac OS X</strong><br />
        Tyris Flare for Mac OS X is distributed as a compressed tarball and includes a WeiDU installer.</p>
      <p>First, extract the files from the tarball into your game directory. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-tyrisflare</strong>, <strong>setup-tyrisflare.command</strong>, and the folder <strong>tyrisflare</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-tyrisflare.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-tyrisflare.command</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>Linux</strong><br />
        Tyris Flare for Linux is distributed as a compressed tarball and does not include a WeiDU installer.</p>
      <p>Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.</p>
      <p>Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="http://www.weidu.org/%7Ethebigg/">WeiDU.org</a> and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal, cd to your game installation directory, run tolower   and answer Y to both queries. You can avoid running the second option   (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save   time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the   first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only   this mod since the last time you lowercased file names. If you're   unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.</p>
      <p>To install, run WeInstall tyrisflare in your game folder. Then run wine BGMain.exe and start playing. </p>
      <p><strong> Note for Complete Uninstallation</strong><br />
        In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely uninstall the mod using setup-tyrisflare --uninstall at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts. . </p>

      <p>The mod contains several components that can be installed independently
  of one another. </p>
      <p><strong>Tyris Flare NPC</strong> 
      </p>
      <p>This is the main component that will add Tyris Flare to your Shadows of Amn or Throne of Bhaal game.
        She can be found in the Umar Hills, vaguely near the cave.</p>
      <p><strong>Alternate Portraits</strong><br />
        <em>Requires <b>Tyris Flare NPC</b></em></p>
      <p>This multiple-choice component allows you to optionally install one of <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/gallery/album/36-tyris-flare/">seven
        alternate portraits</a> for Tyris.</p>

</div>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>Meet Tyris Flare, a red-haired amazon who can kick ass and hurl fire!</p>
  <p>Sound familiar?  That's because I decided to have a nostalgia trip
  and recreate a character from ye olde Golden Axe computer games that were
  released on the Sega Mega Drive (or Genesis in America) and arcade machines in
  the 90s.  You may also have seen her recently in Golden Axe: Beast Master, though
  my interpretation of the character is from the older games.</p>
  <p>How does she end up in Baldur's Gate II?  You'll have to play to find out!</p>
  <p>Once in your party, Tyris will banter with all BioWare NPCs and can be romanced
  by any human/elf/half-elf male PC.  Enjoy!</p>
</div>
<h2>Compatibility </h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>This mod is designed to work with Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn with or
  without the Throne of Bhaal expansion pack or Baldur's Gate II - Enhanced Edition.
  The mod should be compatible with other
  <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> mods. </p>
</div>
<h2>Installation </h2>
<div class="section">
  <p><strong>Windows</strong><br />
    Tyris Flare is packaged and installed with <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>
    and is distributed as  a self-extracting archive. To install, simply double-click
    the archive and follow the instructions on screen. </p>
  <p>Alternatively the files can be extracted from the archive using
  <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7-Zip</a>. If properly extracted, you should
  have a TyrisFlare folder and Setup-TyrisFlare.exe in your

  Setup-TyrisFlare.exe and follow the instructions on screen. </p>
  <p>Please run Setup-TyrisFlare.exe in your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>

</div>
<h2>Contents </h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>The mod contains several components that can be installed independently
  of one another. </p>
  <p><strong>Tyris Flare NPC</strong><br />
  <p>This is the main component that will add Tyris Flare to your Shadows of Amn or Throne of Bhaal game.
  She can be found in the Umar Hills, vaguely near the cave.</p>
  <p><strong>Alternate Portraits</strong><br />
    <em>Requires <b>Tyris Flare NPC</b></em></p>
  <p>This multiple-choice component allows you to optionally install one of six
  alternate portraits for Tyris.</p>
